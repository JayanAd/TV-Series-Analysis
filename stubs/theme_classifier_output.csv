1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox\Nappeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains\Nand create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to\Ndefend their village from attack. We have to wait until\Nthe Fourth Hokage gets here! We can't let it get any closer\Nto our village! One great Ninja was able to\Nimprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as…\Nthe Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You're really gonna get it this time! I don't care! You know your problem? You can't do the things I do! Only I can do this! I'm better than all of you!\NBelieve it! There's a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto\Nthe Mountainside Images… And he vandalized and\Ngraffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha… Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here,\Nlruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here\Nwhen you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test\Nand the one before that. This is no time\Nto be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on\Nthe Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed\Nwill take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go… Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it's all your fault. Like I care!! OK… Good luck, Naruto… Transform! How was it? I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""! You fool!\NStop making idiotic spells! Darn… Darn… I won't let you go home\Nunless you clean that all up. I don't care… There's nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was… If you clean up all that mess,\NI'll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes!\NI-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don't you know who\Nthe Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title\NLord Hokage because they were the best Ninja\Nof their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage\Nwas a hero who saved the village from\Nthe nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I'll become a Hokage myself. And I'll be the greatest Hokage\Nof all time! So that everyone will finally\Nlearn to accept me! By the way, Sensei,\NI have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm…No… Can I borrow that Leaf headband\Nfor a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who\Nhave graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will… You're so mean! So that's why you took off\Nyour goggles… Humph...\NOne more bowl please! We are now about to begin\Nthe graduation test. When your name is called,\Nproceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no… Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still…\NI will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination\Nand stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up\Nwith something. Isn't that enough\Nfor him to pass? Mizuki Sensei...\NAll the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it's practically useless.\NI can't give him a passing mark. I 'm a Ninja now! You did well. That's my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I'll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It's that boy.\NI hear he's the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen\Nif he became a Ninja. Isn't that the boy\Nwho is actually… Hey! We're not supposed to\Ntalk about that. Iruka.\NWe need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn't trying\Nto be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong\Nfrom the bottom of his heart. You both don't have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice… I'll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But… Naruto also grew up without knowing\Nthe love of his parents…like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are\Nstill out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What's the matter? Come to Lord Hokage's immediately! I heard that Naruto…\Nstole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let's see… The first Jutsu is…\NMulti-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at? Lord Hokage!\NWe can't forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item\Nthat the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use… It will be a major disaster if\Nit is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go…Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village\Nabout this and eliminate Naruto… Then the Scroll of Sealing\Nwill be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I've only learned one Jutsu. He's been practicing the Jutsu… until he's become\Nthis exhausted and dirty…? Listen, listen!\NI'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You're gonna let me graduate\Nif I can do it! Isn't it true that I can graduate if\NI can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me\Nabout this scroll, and this place… Mizuki did?! I'm impressed you found this place. I see now…how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait…\NWhat's going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains\Nforbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to\Nget it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of\Nyou holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki!\NDon't let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don't do that! After an incident 12 years ago,\Na rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody\Nbut you knows. Except me?! 					What is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing\Nthat you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon,\NNine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka's parents and\Ndestroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been\Ndeceiving you ever since. Didn't you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto… Nobody accepts you.\NThat's why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up\Nwithout the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like\Nthe plague after what happened. That's why he keeps misbehaving. It's the only way for him to get\Nany attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough,\Nbut inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! 					Get down! Why…? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me\Nor gave me any support. I wasn't a good student in school. I was the class clown…\Nbecause I wanted people to notice me. I couldn't get noticed through excellence,\Nso I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn't that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely…right?\NAnd you suffered inside, right? I'm sorry, Naruto…. If I had been more responsible,\Nmaybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. Don't make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you,\Never since you killed his parents! He's just saying all that\Nto get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid\Nwho will change his mind. He will take revenge against\Nour village using that scroll! Didn't you see his eyes?\NThose are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No…\NNaruto…isn't…like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto\Nand get the scroll. I'll take care of you later! I-I won't let you… Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt. He might unleash\Nthe power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There's a slight chance\Nhe might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit\Nsealed inside him! If that happens… I've found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said\Nwas a lie! Give me that scroll, quick!\NMizuki is after the scroll! It can't be… Why is it, Naruto? How… did you know I wasn't Iruka…? Because I'm Iruka. I see. What's in it for you to protect\Nthe one who killed your family? I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot\Nlike you get that scroll! You're the idiot.\NNaruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever\Nhe wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster… that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage\Nof the power of that scroll! You're right… I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really\Ncared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he's single-minded\Nand clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows\Nthe meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He's Naruto Uzumaki of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. 					lruka! I was gonna take you down later,\Nbut I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me… Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,\NI'll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid\Nlike you with a single blow! Why don't you try then?\NI'll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let's see you try!\NShow me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You've… Those aren't just images but actual clones!\NThat's an advanced Ninjutsu! What's this…? What's the matter? 					C'mon! Weren't you gonna get me\Nwith one blow? Here! In that case…\NI'll come to you. I kinda got carried away.\Nlruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He's really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all\Nthe Hokage leaders… Naruto, come over here.\NI'd like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad… There's no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He'll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations…on your graduation. In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto… I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult\Nnow that you're a Ninja. But I guess I'll just wait to tell you\Nthat until we get to the ramen stand… W-What do you want, you little shrimp?\NQuit following me! You're smaller than me and you're saying that you're gonna\Nbecome the Fifth Hokage? I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's\Ngrandson or not. It's not that easy to be a Hokage! If you want it that bad,\Nyou're gonna have to beat me first! Next episode:\N ""My Name Is Konohamaru!"" Watch my outstanding performance!",,,,,,,,0.03496374282985926
2,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Hey, you! Are you sure you want\Nto look like that? Yes, of course!\NC'mon! So hurry hurry! Don't regret it later. Say cheese! My Name Is Konohamaru! I couldn't decide on how to look. It took me 3 hours to decide. But as you can see,\Nit's more like a work of art. Doesn't it look great? Take it over. What?! Take it over. Stop saying that! Transform! Oh please, Lord Hokage… The Sexy Jutsu…\NThat's quite a devious technique. By the way Naruto,\Nwhere's your headband? I won't wear it until the orientation.\Nlt might get scratched Well, that's just fine. But the Ninja Registration Form\Nis a very important document held in high regard by our village. Why do you want to look like this? Because! Anyway, how should I know\Nabout all that stuff? Old man!\NGet ready to fight! I am going to be the Fifth Hokage! Ouch! If it's not one thing, it's another…. Drat! Is this a trap? Are you okay,\NHonorable Grandson? May I just inform you that\Nthere aren't any traps here… Huh? What's with this runt? What?! I know this kid…\NHe's that Nine-Tailed boy! He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel! You must have done this to me! You tripped all by yourself, stupid! Hey! Let go of him! He is the Honorable Grandson\Nof the Third Hokage! He stopped as soon as\Nhe learned who I am…. He's like my four-eyed teacher. He's just like everyone else! What's the matter? Weren't you gonna hit me, huh? Can't do it 'cuz\NI'm the Hokage's grandson, eh? As if I care! 					lmbecile! This guy… What?! Good grief… Listen to me. You are the Honorable Grandson\Nof the Third Hokage. Even though that scoundrel hit you,\Nyou must not associate with his kind. Nothing good will come of\Nyour tangling with him. This is your distinguished\Nteacher Ebisu, and I am never wrong\Nabout these things! Don't you want to become\Nthe Fifth Hokage? Then allow me\Nto teach you Ninjutsu, so that your dream will\Nbecome a reality. That's right. Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut\Ntowards becoming the Fifth Hokage. Is that clear, Honorable Grandson? He's gone! It seems he's gone after Naruto. Oh no! This is terrible! Honorable Grandson! How did he become like this? That was the 20th sneak attack today. And now he's in the company of Naruto.\NI'm a bit worried. I just hope he doesn't pick up\Nmore foolishness. Huh? Stop following me! What is it now?! Your camouflage is pathetic. You've seen through my disguise... Your reputation is well-earned. I will allow you to make me\Nyour apprentice. But you must first teach me that\N ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique you used to beat Grandpa Hokage. You gotta be kidding. I beg you to say yes, boss! Huh? Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss! I guess I have no choice. Listen. In order to become a skilled Ninja, you must first learn to\Ncontrol your Chatora. Chatora? Yes, Chatora. Boss, I think you mean Chakra. Silence! That's what real Ninjas call it! Oh! I didn't know that! Whew… I'm glad he's a fool. Listen. Chakra essentially means… Basically, it is the energy needed\Nin order to use Jutsu. Huh? In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts\Ncombine the Chakra, the physical energy accumulated\Nfrom each cell in the body with spiritual energy intensified\Nthrough training and experience. This combined energy is summoned\Nwith certain hand signs. You made me think\Nyou knew all that, when you were just reading\Nfrom a scroll! Much has been said about\Nperfecting the Ninja techniques, but it really boils down\Nto just one thing. And what is that? Hard work and guts. Hard work and guts? That's right. So be ready for the challenging tasks\NI will give you. Yes, boss! Good. Let's start right now.\NTransform for me. Huh? Let me see first\Nhow much you already know. But what do I transform into? OK... First, transform into that lady. An easy task, boss. Transform! Well, do I look like her? Uhm… Well, the clothes do and… And what's so similar\Nabout that?! Honorable Grandson. If you will transform into me,\Nat least try to look a little cuter, OK? She's scary! Why am I the one who gets hit? OK!\NNext, we'll do some research on sexiness! Yes, boss! I told you I don't allow\Nreading here, Naruto! This is the last test.\NPut all of your effort into it! Yes, boss! Transform! Naruto! It's you again! Why is it always me…? Sorry. Huh? It's because\NI'm the Hokage's grandson. Don't worry about it. Huh? You're now ready to perform\Nthe Sexy Jutsu! You just need more practice. Yes, boss! OK, keep in mind…\Nthe point is for ""boom boom boom""! Now do it! Yes, boss! 					Transform! What do you think? That won't do! More slender. Yes, boss! Is this okay? Not yet. 					More attractive. Yes, boss! How about now? That Naruto… What is he teaching\Nthe Honorable Grandson…? Where the hell could they be…? I am a distinguished teacher\Ntraining potential Hokage. All those who interfere\Nwill be eliminated. You know I've been wondering… You seem obsessed with beating\Nyour Grandpa Hokage. My name is Konohamaru. It was Grandpa who gave me\Nthat name. He named me after our village. It should be easy for everyone\Nhere to remember. But nobody ever calls me\Nby that name. When they see me, all they see\Nis the grandson of Lord Hokage. No one sees me for who I really am. I can't stand it anymore. That's why… That's why I want the title\Nof Lord Hokage now. Idiot…Who do you think\Nwill accept you, huh? Huh? You won't win the title\Nthat easily, you know. What?! It's not that simple. If you're really serious about gaining\Nthe title of Lord Hokage… What? You'll have to beat me first! Lord Hokage!\NI've been looking for you. Iruka. Did Naruto re-submit\Nhis Ninja Registration Form? Yes. When I lectured to him the other night\Nat the ramen stand, he said he will make everyone accept him\Nnow that he's a Ninja. He's been happy since then. It might not be easy for Naruto\Nto realize that dream. Huh? As you well know, only the villagers who fought\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago know that the monster is sealed\Ninside Naruto. I ruled that no one shall speak\Nabout that incident. I have severely punished those\Nwho have broken this rule. Now our children know nothing about it. That is the only positive\Ndevelopment for Naruto. Before the Fourth Hokage trapped\Nthe monster and died, his last wish was for the villagers\Nto regard Naruto as a hero. A hero? The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster\Ninto the navel of a newborn baby whose umbilical cord\Nhad just been cut. As the receptacle\Nfor the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, Naruto saved the village. Unfortunately, the other villagers\Ndon't see him like that. Some even say that Naruto is\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself. Little by little, that attitude has been\Npassed down to their own children. Iruka. 					Do you know? What, sir? When someone is hated and people refuse\Nto accept his existence, he sees it in the eyes\Nof the people around him. I have found you! Huh? That Demon Fox!! That cold look!\Nlt's always like that! Honorable Grandson,\Nwe have to go now. No way! I want to beat Grandpa right now\Nso I can win the title of Lord Hokage! Don't get in my way! A Hokage must first know about virtue,\Nhonor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith, judgment, obedience\Nand all that. He must be skilled at more than\Nthousand techniques… And then... Transform! Take this! Sexy Jutsu! What? 					lt didn't work! What kind of a\Ndisgraceful spell is that?! I am a gentleman! Such vulgar attacks\Nwill never work on me! Honorable Grandson!\NThat rascal will only make you an imbecile! Stick with me and... you will gain a shortcut\Ntowards becoming the Fifth Hokage. C'mon, let's go! No way! Shadow Clone Jutsu Wow! 					Fantastic! Ha! 					That's nothing. I am a distinguished teacher. I am not as weak as Mizuki. Boss… Transform! Transform! Oh, Master Ebisu… I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""! He combined the Multiple Clones with\Nhis own Sexy Jutsu. That's another devious attack. I probably won't even survive that one. I can't even beat that\Nfour-eyed teacher of mine! I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!\NI want to be recognized by everybody! But I keep failing. You think it's that easy? Huh? It's given only to the greatest Ninja\Nin the village. Everybody must learn to believe in you. I've been through a lot already. It's been one struggle after another. But after all that,\NI found someone who accepts me. I had to go through a lot...\NJust for one person. You had better push yourself. For what? The path of getting the title,\NLord Hokage, is a brutal one. There's no such thing as a shortcut. If you're really serious about\Nattaining the title of Lord Hokage You'll have to beat me first. Who do you think you are,\Nlecturing me like that? I won't be your apprentice anymore. From now on, you're my rival. Unfortunately for you,\Ntomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy. Still, I'll consider you an equal someday\Nwhen we fight for the title of Lord Hokage. Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru. You still have a long way to go\Nto become a real Ninja. Aaah! Why do I have to be in\Nthe same group with Sasuke? The guy I hate the most? Sakura keeps saying\N ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!"" and doesn't even\Npay attention to me! It makes me so mad!\NI got it! I'm going to pull one on him! I'm not gonna let him be so cool\Nin front of Sakura! Next Episode:\N ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?"" Watch my outstanding performance!",,,,,,,0.06458226591348648,0.007005743216723204
