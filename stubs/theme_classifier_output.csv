187,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain It looks like\Nthe preparations are complete. So this is the Land of Greens\Nyou were talking about, brother? Well, it’s a small land, but it could be a good stepping-stone\Nfor getting ahead in the world. We’ve already bought off\Nhalf of the public officials. This land will be overturned\Non our signal. As of today,\Nwe’re the feudal lords of this land. Feudal lords, huh…? That has a nice ring to it. Open for Business!\NThe Leaf Moving Service This is a problem… I thought about testing out\Nvarious combinations, but it backfired. With these remaining members,\Nthere’s nobody who can take the lead… But it’s merchant protection this time, so no matter who goes,\Nthere probably isn’t much to worry about. Mission difficulty isn’t the issue. It’s a commission from\Nthe Land of Greens. I wanted to send them\Na respectable team. The lord of the castle there\Nwas good to me in the old days! True indeed… He generously assumed the debts\Nfor the bundle you blew on gambling. It’s small,\Nbut it’s a nice and easygoing land. There was an adorable princess,\Nand two boy Ninja looked after her… At that time,\Nthey both said they’d marry me… I wonder if they still feel that way… I don’t think so. I bet they’ve all gotten big… We’ll be at the border soon. This is our last look at this scenery\Nfor a while. All right!\NA mission, a mission! Wait up, Naruto! Everyone else was off on missions, but I've been doing nothing but\Nodd jobs in the village! I was sick of hearing stories\Nabout everyone’s adventures. Still,\Nwe’re guarding merchants this time. It ‘s probably not something\Nto brag about. Then I should exaggerate\Nthe story a bit and say that I took out\Nabout a thousand bandits, right? That’s just lying… Oh! There they are.\NThat’s them! Yahoo! Who’re you? You guys are merchants\Nfrom the Land of Greens, right? That’s right. We’ve come from\Nthe Village Hidden in Leaves to protect you guys.\NBelieve it. The Village Hidden in Leaves? See…? 					This, this. We were told to protect you\Nfrom mountain bandits… It’s for certain. I’m Naruto Uzumaki. And this is Hinata. I’m Choji Akimichi. Um, we received one more item\Nfrom the Hokage to identify ourselves with. Hey, Momiji. Give it back. Oh, it’s true. These people are from\Nthe Village of the Hidden Leaf. See…?\N74.01	01:30:15:10	01:30:17:11	The Leaf Moving Service Wh-What’s that? Old lady Tsunade…\Nshe’s done it this time! I see. I’m Kikusuke. This is Yurinoshin. He’s Shun. I’m Momiji!\NWe’ll be counting on you movers! You sure eat a lot. That’s why you're so f… Fa?! …full figured. For you. I love people with great strength. Something like this is a cinch. See? Watch. Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll… Somebody help me! That Choji, getting all carried away. Move faster, mover. We’re rapidly falling behind. We’re not movers, I’m telling you. Why don’t you help out\Nbefore complaining?! No, it’s fine. Our cousin Shun is in poor health. You don’t need to worry,\NKikusuke, Yurinoshin. I had no intention of\Nlistening to anything this good-for-nothing has had to say\Nfrom the start. Who’s a good-for-nothing?!\NJust you watch! Honestly,\Nit’s because you push yourself too far… I’m sorry…\NShun’s being unreasonable. Water! 					Oh. Mine’s empty, too. Then there’s some fresh drawn water. Here! Wow,\Nhow’d you find water in a place like this? My grandma taught me. Your grandma? It's this… You can tell with this. What?! 					With those? It’s called dousing. If you concentrate\Non the item you’re looking for… these rods will react to that item\Nand will inform you when you're near it. It’s knowledge passed on\Nfrom our predecessors. When I get back to the village, maybe I'll try to find money\Nthat people dropped with that. Tasty! It doesn’t compare to the water\Nin the Land of Greens, but it's good water. Come to think of it,\Nwhat kind of place is the Land of Greens? The Land of Greens is…\Na small land deep in the mountains. Everyone in the land loves nature\Nand is warm-hearted. It was indeed Shangri-La… Was…? Oh, it’s nothing… But, you know, if it’s such a great place,\Nwhy do you need protection? It’s targeted because\Nthe people take peace for granted! What do you mean by that? Stuff like loving nature\Nand being warm-hearted sounds nice. But the bottom line is that the people\Nin the Land of Greens are all softhearted. We live in a troubled time now. Something like believing in people\Nis ridiculous. Hey, the Land of Greens\Nis not something to speak ill of like that. The lord of the castle there was kind\Neven to us merchants passing through. To think he’d take up that kind of attitude\Nwith an old lady… He’s kind of disagreeable. He’s your cousin, right?\NDo something about him. R-Right. He’s probably a bit touchy\Nfrom the bad things that have happened. I’m sorry… Oh, i-it’s okay… Hey, that’s dangerous. It’s dangerous\Nto wander around alone. Brother Choji, look at that… Naruto! What is it? That. Wh-What is that? That’s in the direction of\Nthe Land of Greens, right?! I’m going to go check it out…\NYou take the others and go on ahead. I’ll be right back. Listen. What we saw here is a secret. We don’t want everyone to get worried. Yeah. 					Got it. Huh? Where’s Naruto? Th-The bathroom… I’ll give this to you\Nif you tell me what you saw earlier. Black smoke… 					was rising. Black smoke…?! 					From where? The direction of the Land of Greens. Lord Shun… It’s finally… I should be at the Land of Greens\Nborder pretty soon. Wh-What was that …?\NThere was no presence at all. Who’re you guys! Who’re you guys? That headband. You’re with\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village, right? So what if I am?\NWhy are you targeting me? I have no intention\Nof fighting you guys. It seems the ones we are looking for\Nare heading this direction, you see. Those who prowl around here will die. Did we do it…? The Substitution Jutsu?! The real one is over here! These guys are pretty good. Two left. One of them is the real one! What?! Too bad!\NThose two are also clones. I’m going to turn back for now… Choji! Hinata! How’d it go, Naruto? Actually, there’s trouble… Guys! Let’s take a break here\Nfor the time being! Pursuers from the Land of Greens? They said that… The ones they were looking for\Nwere headed in this direction. But why would Ninja\Nbe after this group? These people are just merchants,\Naren’t they? And they’re not even people\Nfrom the Land of Greens to begin with… Now that you mention it,\Nthat’s right. But what will we do? We’re going to engage them if they come,\Nof course. That might be impossible… We have elderly people\Nand children with us. You’re right… I know. It could be that\Nthey’re not chasing after us! What do you mean by that? Basically, we’re moving\Nin the same direction as their true target and we could just be\Nin their battle ground…or something. I see. That means if we clear the path,\Nthey’ll let us go right by. Alright. Listen up, guys! Some kind of troublesome guys\Nare heading this way. Troublesome guys? Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious\Nif you say it like that. I-I see… But you don’t need to worry. They’re probably not after us… It’ll kind of be the long way around, but we’ll make it through\Nif we take a little side turn up ahead. Does this feudal lord really have this little? He’s a feudal lord\Nwho’s a prestigious ruler of virtue. So he would never line his pockets. But we’ll squeeze out a big pile\Nfrom now on. More importantly, has\Nthe young girl in question been found? Nope… But the two who were tracking her\Ngot attacked. We know the direction she fled in. That young girl just would not be good. If they get away, they may return\Nwith forces from other lands. If the sun were a little stronger, I could burned down a whole mountain\Nwith my Jutsu… Then I’ll go… Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators\Nin the hall as you ordered… Oh, good work. Without your guys’ help, we couldn’t have\Nbrought down the castle this easily … Then brother,\Nshall we go for the hall greeting? Okay… I’ll take care of things here. So, about the thing you promised… Oh, that’s right. Take as much there as you like. Really? Honestly. It’s so easy to deceive\Nsofthearted people… It really is exactly so. Our lord believed in us\Nuntil the very end… Come on. If you stuff that much in there,\Nthe ferry on death’s river will sink. I make it a habit not to believe in people. Especially people\Nwho have betrayed someone once… Y-You’re joking, Lord Renga… It’s no joke. C-Could it be that you had me\Ngather the collaborators in the coup to… You’re also softhearted! That should do it. Yurinojou, it seems they’re after us. Yes. I leave Lady Haruna to you. What are you going to do? If we wait here for their attack,\Nthere will be too many to defend. Since it’s come to this,\NI’ll slow them down. But according to the information, they are three Janin\Nwho use unknown Jutsu. I know. But my Jutsu will not be defeated\Nby the likes of them. Very well. Go, Kikunojou. Yes, Lady Haruna. Naruto. I set a trap for the time being. Jeez, Hinata.\NYou’re such a worrywart. You don’t need to go that far. Huh? Yurinoshin,\Nwhere’s Kikusuke? You’re right. 					Since when…? Oh, he had some other business\Nand went on ahead… Say what? Taking liberties like that\Nis really a problem… Oh, I see. So that’s it, huh? What is it? Even Kikusuke makes sure\Nto go to the bathroom. Naruto…! Lady Haruna, I shall protect you\N with my life! There! Who’re you…?! I’m Ruiga. To think you’d\Njust come right on out nonchalantly. Then she must in that group, right? If it’s one against one,\NI won’t lose to a hired Ninja like you! Can you do it? Have a taste of\Nthe Land of Greens’ Flower Ninja Art! Eat this! Flower Shuriken!\NFlying Flowers: Falling Foliage! Too easy… I don’t know about that! Flower Ninja Art: Release!\NMyriad of Flowers! Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon! Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh?\NFutile, futile! And Genjutsu next, huh? This is the finishing blow. Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!\NMyriad of Flowers! Too bad. The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja\Ncan’t beat me. Now it’s my turn! Eat this. Water Style: Liquid Memory! Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone. In a strange park,\NI play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm. Yellow Moon. Even now, counting to three,\NI open my eyes Shadow Moon I am still dreaming. Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,\Nas we face one another’s back Look at my eyes, when can we meet? EveryDay EveryNight\NWith every word I can think of Right away, my messy feelings as is, A magical chord change, in a restless city A daily JAZZ Guitar played\Nin a soft minor key A running-ramen strategy, huh? In other words, we split up\Nin order to avoid annihilation, right? With this,\Nthe protection burden will decrease. But won’t the soup spill if it runs? This is an example. It’d still be trouble\Neven if it’s just an example, believe it. Then, let’s make it\Nthe running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy. If you say so, Naruto.

144,"Hey boys, listen up! Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something – Sumptuous meal!\N– Sumptuous meal! I feel a little thrown off balance. Let’s regroup, everybody! Go! I’m itchy, Elder Brother. Yeah, itchy… Huh?! My punches aren’t having\Nany effect whatsoever. Naruto… This doesn’t look good. Again! Huh? I-It itches, Elder Brother. Yeah…feels like I’m getting a rash. D-Damn! I’m not done yet! Stop it, Naruto! It’s futile… – You won't swagger like that for long!\N– You won't swagger like that for long! This feels so good! What’s up with those guys anyway? You’re an idiot brat as always. You have it hard, don’t you? Having to go on a mission\Nwith that failure of a brat. Don’t you, Iruka? Why, Mizuki?! I’m asking you, please stop\Nthis kind of foolishness! Are you intending to betray\Nyour comrades from the village again? Comrades? That's right!\NYour comrades from the Leaf Village with whom you shared\Nboth pleasures and pain! You can understand that,\Ncan’t you? Comrades…huh? As usual, you are naïve,\Naren’t you…lruka? What I believe in is power! Don’t think you can shackle me with\Nsuch vague bonds like that of comrades! Mizuki… I will soon get my hands\Non the ultimate power! Lord Orochimaru’s power! Orochimaru?! Then I’ll teach you a lesson! About how meaningless it is… that thing you and the other Leaf guys\Ndescribe as camaraderie or whatever! Mizuki… You were an excellent Shinobi despite\Nhaving committed that crime, you… Don’t talk so knowingly! Damn! They’re dodging all my attacks! Iruka, if you insist so much,\Nwhy don't you show me? What degree of feeling\Nyou really have for your comrades… I wonder whether you’ll really\Nbe able to stop me? Come! Wait! Naruto! Forget about these guys!\NPursue Mizuki! Damn…! I’m gonna settle this later\Nwithout fail! Elder Brother, that guy went off. They all went off, didn’t they? Elder Brother, could this be\Na game of hide-and-go-seek? Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek! So does that mean we’re “It”? Those jerks! Making us “It” without even deciding\Nby scissors-paper-rock! – Let's go, Raijin! 					– Okay! A New Squad!\N                           Two People and a Dog?! Over here…lruka. Hurry, Naruto! Don't be fooled this time! Shut up! It’s 100 years too soon\Nto be arguing with me! I’m telling you, if you dilly-dally the situation’s gonna\Nget really troublesome again! What?! Found you! Good job, huh, Elder Brother! Yeah! I don’t have time to be\Ndealing with these guys! Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun,\Nbut aren’t you getting hungry? You’re really something,\Naren’t you, Raijin? Leave some for your Elder Brother! Of course, I will! Hey, you idiot brothers! – Huh? 					– Huh? This is no time to be eating! I’m telling you, it’s foolhardy\Nto be fighting these guys! I already know that! Mizuki! Where are you?! What’s the matter…lruka? Weren’t you gonna stop me? Stop this foolishness, Mizuki! Come on out, Mizuki! Always be aware of\Nan attack from behind… For a Shinobi,\Nisn’t that a basic rule? Nicely done, Iruka. Pretty good! Always read behind the surface\Nof your enemy’s bluffs… For a Shinobi isn’t that a basic rule? That’s my line! What’s that? A Smoke Bomb? Shadow Clone Jutsu! – Come on over! Catch us if you can!\N– Come on over! Catch us if you can! Elder Brother, they’re increasing!\NThey’re increasing! Raijin, this must be\Nsuper hide-and-go-seek, don’t you think? Yeah. That’s right! A decoy strategy, huh?\NYou thought it through. We can buy some time this way. All right, now's our chance… – Super, super hide-and-go-seek!\N– Super, super hide-and-go-seek! There are,\Nthere are two Old Lady Tsunades! You’re talking about\Nthe idiotic strength, huh? Haven’t you come to\Nyour senses yet?! Shut up! Why are you so obsessed with power! Because that, if anything,\Nis everything! Reconsider, Mizuki!\Nlt isn’t too late yet! You are naive! Don’t you understand the situation?! What’s the matter?\NCome on and attack, Iruka! You’re not my enemy! You’re my comrade from\Nthe same village! I told you, I’m tired of that kind of\Nsong and dance! And moreover…\Nyou’re my colleagu! You’re a member of the same family\Nthat inherited the same Will of Fire! Will of Fire, huh? Yes, that’s right. Therefore, please stop\Nthe foolishness, Mizuki! It irks me most when\Nyou say things like that! Mizuki! Since we’re old acquaintances\NI was gonna kill you quickly. But now I’ve decided against that. You’re gonna have some fun… I’ll give you a taste of how it feels to be killed slowly by\Nyour so-called comrade! Hey, Naruto… How long are you\Nplanning to be like that? It’s just a matter of time till\Nthose guys find you! I found you! What?! They found us! All right! This is it! Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Elder Brother,\Nsuper hide-and-go-seek again? I’m getting bored with this. Shadow Clone again?! As always,\Nyou have no new tricks, huh! Just leave it to me! All right! Go! – Okay! 					– Go! Wh-What?! What kind of game is this? Wow, they're going so fast. I see… Not bad. I-I feel sick… Elder Brother. I’m woozy… Now! Catch them! Huh?! You jerks… What do you think you’re doing? The preparation’s done! Here it goes!\NYou fatso Herculean brothers! Concentrate… I must concentrate… Stop putting on airs! A guy like you,\Nwho’s weaker than me! Yeah! That’s right, isn’t it?! You always excelled over\Nanything I did, didn’t you…? I was always being helped by you,\Nwasn’t I? One year has passed already, hasn’t it? It’s not so easy to laugh,\Nhiding your sadness. Your teacher told me that\Nyou are the center of the laughter. I’m not sad at all! It’s an honor for Shinobi\Nto die during their missions! My dad and mom… are heroes who protected this village\Nfrom the Demon Fox! And I am the child of those heroes. That’s why I’m not sad\Neven though I’m alone… These tears are from the happiness... Enough already. I’m always aware that\Nyou are feeling lonely. But you are not alone. All of Leaf’s Shinobi\Nhave the “Will of Fire.” “Will of Fire”? It means the will to protect the Leaf. As long as you have\Nthe Will of Fire, you and people in this village\Nare all family. Iruka, I wonder if you have that. Yeah. Huh…? Who’s that over there? Mizuki… What are you doing there? Well, I heard that Iruka\Nwas depressed these days… I was worried and came to look for him. Everybody’s…worried about you, Iruka. Everybody’s waiting over there.\NCome on and play with us! It’s all right… Go on. The Mizuki that I idolized was kind… And he was a guy who was more\Nthoughtful of his friends than anyone else. Yet… Please remember! Mizuki! You really are… an idiot, aren’t you?! L-Let go… Here it goes… S-Stop please! I-I feel sick… – Huh? 					– Eh? What? Elder Brother, don’t tell me that you… Sorry, Raijin… I squashed… our lunch! What?! Stay still, guys! Now take this…! – Give us back our lunch!\N– Give us back our lunch! What?! H-He’s done it, huh… It doesn’t look like you understand me,\Nso let me explain. The real reason I was kind to you… Because it made me happy\Nmore than anything to see you in your misery! Hey, Iruka! We’re gonna go play soccer right now. Come join us, Iruka! Sure! Okay! I wonder if Iruka’s okay after all those things\Nthat happened to him… That’s why we need to\Ntry to cheer him up! Why…only him… Everybody makes a fuss about him just because of his parents\Ngetting killed by Nine-Tail… Serves you right… Even Lord Hokage?! Why…why is it?! Who is it over there? All right… I’m gonna try to gain the favor\Nof Lord Hokage too… What are you doing over there? Well, I heard that Iruka has been\Ndepressed recently so… You’re lying! Treating a guy who’s weaker\Nthan oneself with disdain is the most pleasurable\Nfeeling of all, Iruka. You weren’t that way in the past! That’s why I’ve been telling you…\Nyou’re naïve! That kind of naiveté leads to fatal mistakes\Non the battleground. On the battleground, it’s all about\Nhow many enemies you can kill! If you throw a Kunai blindly\Nin a bamboo grove, all that will happen is that it’ll bounce off\Nand its path will be errant. If you’re gonna take aim…\Nmake it straight! Don’t think I’m gonna get fooled twice\Nwith the same bait! Damn… I’m at a disadvantage if\Nwe fight in a place like this! Mizuki… You… Mizuki! I told you, it’s useless… If the path is going to be errant, then one just needs to calculate\Nthe path of the Kunai when throwing it! So you’ve finally gotten serious, huh? Follow me! Where is this? Looks like you’re finally conscious. You jerk… You ruined our meal… Don’t even think\Nwe’re gonna let you leave here alive! I’m going for his stomach! I’m going for his head! – One, two… 					– One, two… – Three! 					– Three! Huh? Huh?! Wh-What is going on? Gimme a break,\Nwhat are you doing?! Wh-Who’s that? It’s too much of a drag\Nto tell you my name, however…! The most powerful support squad\Nassigned to this mission! The most powerful trio from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves! We’re Ino-Shika-Cho! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah What's with these guys?!\NThey have super ridiculous strength! To think they can resist Shadow Possession Jutsu\Nto this extent on sheer power! If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now,\Nwe'll be in a hairy spot! Our only choice is to\Nsettle this right away.

That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away Who’re you guys? I’m in a bad mood right now. If you wanna continue to fight, I won't go easy on you. You stop your babbling, weakling. Hey, come over here. I’m gonna play\Ndo-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do on you… while I snap your ribs! I’ll do it! What?! He got both of my legs\Nwith his string…! Why you--! Humph! Let’s hear a nice sound. Do! W-What?! Re! Wh-Where is he attacking from?! Your bones make\Na really low sound, don’t they? Let’s hear a much sharper reverberation,\Nshall we? Right? Next, I’ll go for\Na mi-fa-so tri-combination. Wha--?! What?! Last! Lions Barrage! An Invitation from the Sound Here you are! I’m digging in! Sakura! Go on, eat, eat! The Chinese-style barbecued pork\Nramen noodles here are fabulous! Don’t worry. It’s my treat. Right, chef? You’re gonna treat your girl. You’re growing up, aren’t you, Naruto? Wh-Wh-What?! Wh-What the heck are\Nyou talking about? I need to have an important conversation\Nwith Sakura today… Sh-She’s not my girl\Nor anything like that… Sakura? Sorry, Naruto. I was little spaced out. This looks delicious. Now then… Let’s eat! Let’s eat! Yeah! Tell me about Sasuke\Nwhile we eat. Sasuke told me not to tell you this,\NNaruto, but… It’s all that guy Orochimaru’s fault… S-Stop! Kakashi Sensei said it would be fine\Nand I’d like to believe that too… But when he was battling Gaara… Earlier today… Sasuke was wearing the same expression\Nas the time before. That’s why I… Orochimaru, huh?\NI ran into him again a little while back. Really? Where?! When I was searching for\NOld Lady Tsunade… Die! Shoot! Pervy Sage and the old lady… Despite the fact that\Nhe was fighting two of them at once, he was incredibly powerful. He’s one dangerous dude. That strong… It’ll all be fine, believe it! Sasuke wouldn’t fall to\Nthat kind of guy’s enticement. He’s already a really powerful guy, so he wouldn’t need to do\Nthat kind of thing! I guarantee it! Yeah! Why does Master Orochimaru\Nwant this guy anyway? Kimimaro would have\Nbeen much better… Well, if you stay in\Na seedy place like this, you’ll just remain mediocre at best. You’ll never become strong… Wh-Why…? All my barrages were solid.\NYet this guy… doesn't seem to have\Nsustained any damage. If you keep on fooling around\Nplaying Ninja with your friends, you’re just gonna continue to rot. Come with us. If you do,\NMaster Orochimaru will empower you. There’s no meaning\Nif we take you by force, he said. You decide. Gimme a break… Master Orochimaru sure sent me\Non a bothersome mission. Hey! What did you decide? Are you coming? Or are you not coming?! Decide already! When a weakling like you lags, it makes me wanna just finish you! Try me…! You…those Curse Marks… Don’t be so sure that you’re the only favorite\Nof Master Orochimaru. One shouldn’t use Curse Marks\Nthat lightly. Or rather…it looks like you’re not\Neven able to control the Curse Marks. If they continue to be released\Nfor a long period of time, Curse Marks will progressively\Neat your body. It looks like you’re still at first state, so the speed at which they will\Neat away at you is still fairly slow. But when they have entirely eaten you, you will lose yourself. Forever. In exchange for having been\Nempowered by Curse Marks, you will be tethered\Nby Master Orochimaru. We no longer have anything\Nlike freedom. In order to receive something,\None must discard something. What is your objective? Are you and your comrades\Njust going to comfort each other in this lukewarm village… then simply forget all about… Itachi Uchiha? Don’t forget your objective. This kind of village does\Nnothing more than shackle you! Cut your stupid ties with this place. If you do that, you’ll… be able to obtain much,\Nmore fabulous power. Don’t forget your objective! Thanks! H-Hey Sakura. I’ll walk you home! Huh? Don’t worry about it. Why, why?\NThe streets are dangerous at night! They’re well lit, so I’ll be fine… Sakura? Thanks, Naruto. But I want to go home alone tonight. I see… I’ll be fine! Yeah! Why are you hanging around in a place\Nlike this in the middle of the night? One has to pass down this road\Nto leave the village. Go home and sleep. Why… Why won’t you tell me anything? Why are you always silent like that? You won’t tell me one single thing. Why should I have to tell you anything?! I’m telling you to keep your nose\Nout of my business. Stop bothering me\Nover everything I do. I…make you dislike me\Nall the time, don’t I? Do you remember? We just became Genin and\Nthe Three-Man Squads were assigned… You and I were alone for\Nthe first time, here at this very spot. You got mad at me. See! That guy doesn’t\Nhave parents, right? He’s all alone and he doesn’t have to deal\Nwith parents lecturing him… That’s why he can sometimes\Nbe selfish! Solitude… Huh? Isn’t the same as being scolded\Nby one’s parents. What’s the matter all of a sudden…. You…are annoying… I don’t remember that. Yeah, I guess…\Nthat was long ago, after all… But it all began that day. Sasuke and me… And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei… The four of us went\Non various missions, didn’t we? Those were tough and\Ndifficult times, but… But… more than anything… it was so much fun! I know about your family, Sasuke… But revenge… that won’t bring anyone happiness. No one… Neither you… nor I. As I expected… I’m different from you guys… I’m walking a road that’s incompatible\Nwith the rest of you. The four of us worked together… and it’s true that there was a time\Nwhen I thought that was my road. The four of us have worked together, but in the end,\NI decided on revenge. That’s been my reason for living. I can’t become like\Nyou and Naruto. Are you going to isolate\Nyourself again, Sasuke?! You taught me that solitude\Nis a very rough thing that time, Sasuke! Now I know exactly how that feels. I have both family and friends… But if you were no longer here, Sasuke… for me… for me it would be the same as solitude. From here again… we’re going to start walking\Nour new paths individually. I…! I love you so very, very much, Sasuke! If you would only be with me, Sasuke, I won't let you regret it,\Nno matter what! I’ll make it fun every day and\Nyou will definitely find happiness! I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke! So…I’m begging you,\Nplease stay here! I’ll even help you with your revenge! I’ll make it happen somehow,\NI promise you…! So stay here…with me…! If that doesn’t work for you… Then take me with you… You really are…annoying. Don’t go! If you go, I’ll scream and… Sakura… Thank you… Sasuke… We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke. What’s your intention? It was already decided that\Nyou would be our leader the moment you exited the village. Please forgive our rudeness\Nup to now. I don’t care about any of that. Let’s go. This is the beginning!

She ought to retrieve\Nthe documents she forgot herself… Huh… What’s the matter? Hey! Wake up! You’ll catch cold if you sleep\Nin a place like this. Thank you… Huh! Sasuke! Good work… Fifth Hokage! You were asleep\Njust now, weren’t you? When you made us\Ngo to fetch the documents! And only you got to sleep! More importantly, Lady Hokage, there’s something\NI want to report to you. What is it? What did you just say?! Is that true?! Yes… According to Sakura Haruno,\Nit appears that there’s no mistake… Unbelievable…\NThat they should already be on the move… In addition to getting what I want… This time, I will completely\Ndestroy Leaf Village. So what that pervert wants... is the Uchiha’s powers, huh… Izumo! Kotetsu! There’s somebody\NI want you to bring here! Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!\NYour Dad’s mission starts today, too! There’s not that much time\Nfor morning training! OK, OK. One OK is enough! Nag, nag, nag from early\Nin the morning… I wonder who it could be\Nso early in the morning? Hey…Dad… What is it? Why did you marry\Na hard-edged woman like Mom? Let’s see now… Even though Mom's like that,\Nshe smiles gently sometimes… Maybe that’s why… Is that the only reason? Shikamaru! A messenger of the Fifth Hokage\Nis here. Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out\Nof the village late last night. And…there is almost no mistake that he is headed for\Nthe Village Hidden in the Sound! Slipped out?! Why… Because he was enticed by\Nthat Orochimaru! W-W-Wait a minute! Why does Sasuke have to be enticed\Nby a risky guy like that?! The reason doesn’t matter.\Nln any case, there’s no time. You will perform your first mission\Nas a Chunin… So all I have to do\Nis bring Sasuke back? As long as there aren’t\Nany enemies around, that shouldn’t be\Ntoo much of a hassle… Yes… However, not only is time\Nof the essence on this mission, but it may turn into something\Nquite difficult. Huh?! There is a strong possibility that those under the control of Orochimaru\Nare guiding Sasuke. This is turning into a real pain\Nin the neck. That guy… I held him in high respect\Nin so many different ways… In that case, please give me\Na four-man team composed only of Jonin and Chunin. I’m afraid I can’t do that… Huh! Why?! You already know\Nthe answer to that… Right now, only the barest minimum\Nnumber of Jonin have been left behind and the others have all\Nleft the village on missions. Within the next 30 minutes, I want you to gather all the Genin you\Nconsider the best, and leave this village! It’s a drag but… I know the guy,\Nso I just can’t just let the matter go. What shall be, shall be… There’s one guy\NI want to recommend. What! You’ve gotta be kidding! You are such a drag starting\Nso early in the morning… But why this guy? That jerk! Hey, just wait here! I’ll change my clothes immediately! So, do you have your eye… on any other guys besides me\Nwho are excellent? Yeah… Wake up! Hey! You said excellent guys, right… Can’t be helped… Potato chips? They’re barbecued meat flavor…\Nyou help out too! Huh?! Here he comes! Even if it is just potato chips, I won’t let anybody else have\Nthe last piece, no matter who you are. Choji and I have worked as\Na team for many years, so coordinating with him\Nis easiest for me. I understand that, but in this kind of situation,\None would normally solicit Shino first! Oh, shut up. Fat chance...! Shino is on a special mission\Nwith his father. Hey…don’t tell me… Right. He's in. No way...! I see… Sounds interesting… It looks like it was worth getting up early\Nand going for a walk, doesn’t it? Shikamaru, what about the other guys? I’d like to take my time to look for some,\Nbut we’re pressed for time. If we don’t find anybody else\Nby the time we leave the village, it will be just us! It appears that your operation\Nwas a success. Yeah… Is it okay for you\Nto be released already? I was told that I would be able\Nto undertake light training soon. I see… I see… It’s a hassle,\Nbut the more people the better… Damn… At a time like this, I… Lee! Do what you need to do. I’ll climb these steps alone\Nstarting tomorrow! Lee… I’ll be fine! You go! We’re at our time limit! Well, I’ve assembled five people… All right! Everybody, follow me! Hey… Hey, Naruto… I’m supposed to be the squad leader.\NThough it sure is a drag… You really think everything will be okay\Nif things are left in your hands? You don’t seem very reliable… What’s up with you acting\Nlike the boss, Naruto? Although being ordered about by\Nsome unmotivated guy like Shikamaru doesn’t sit right with me either… But Shikamaru is already a Chunin! We have to follow his orders. What that means is that\Nthe elders of the village recognized him as capable of being a leader. Since that’s the case,\Ncome up with some strategy and plan. From what I heard,\Nthere are enemies and there’s a strong possibility\Nthat they’re gonna ambush us. For a start,\Nas this is a rescue operation, we will be in the position\Nof pursuit. In other words,\Nthe enemy can easily gain the initiative. Therefore, I will decide\Non a deployment formation that will respond quickly\Nto any assault by the enemy. If you ignore me and\Nmove of your own accord, we will all die. We will go in a single file formation. First of all,\Nthe all-important spearhead will be… Kiba, that’s you! You and Akamaru go on\Nwalks year round and are therefore well-versed in the terrain\Nand geography of the Land of Fire. And since your nose is\Nvery sensitive, you can track Sasuke\Nwith your sense of smell and, you can distinguish booby traps\Nthat carry the enemy’s scent which makes them\Neasy to find… And moreover, you and Akamaru as\Na pair will be extremely efficient in compensating for the weakness\Nof a single file formation to assault. And…second in line will be me,\Nthe squad leader. I can give orders\Nas required in any situation from my position\Ndirectly behind Kiba and can give orders to those behind me\Nusing only hand signals. And in the middle...\Nin the number three position is Naruto. The middle position is\Nthe best for you, since you're capable\Nof executing quick moves and are able to respond immediately\Nto anything in front or behind. You're the cornerstone...\NAnd you have Shadow Clone, too. And fourth in line is Choji. You. You don't have speed, but your ability to strike is the best\Namong the squad members. Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto\Nwill launch a surprise attack and I’ll use you to launch\Nthe deciding blow. In other words, your role is\Nto attack the routed enemy. And then, on the tail end\Nwill be you, Neji… You are assigned to\Nthe most difficult position of rear lookout. You will use your Byakugan\Nto constantly check that there are no loopholes\Nin the ranks. Got it? Take a careful look at this. Use this diagram to verify\Nthe radius of your assigned watch. Kiba watches the front, I’m responsible for\Na wide forward view, Naruto watches left, Choji right,\Nand Neji… Using your Byakugan,\Nyou cover the entire area to the rear. I want to familiarize myself\Nwith our current military potential. Let me check all the Ninja equipment\Neach of you currently has… I will commit that\Nto memory straight away. Any questions? Even though he just assembled\Nhis men a short while ago, he’s already created\Nthe best possible formation… If not, I want to tell you\Nthe most important thing last. Sasuke and I aren’t close friends. In fact, I don’t particularly like him. However, he is also a Shinobi belonging\Nto the Village Hidden in the Leaves. He is a comrade! Therefore, I will put my life\Non the line to help him! That’s the way\Nof the Leaf Village. In this case, even I can’t just sit back\Nand be a sluggard. Because I am responsible\Nfor your lives. Wow… You’re acting kind of\Nlike a Chunin, aren’t you?! Okay then, as soon as he's checked\Nour Ninja tools, we’ll depart. Everybody, take out your Ninja tools. Sasuke wouldn’t fall victim\Nto that kind of guy’s enticement… He’s already\Na really powerful guy, so he wouldn’t need to do\Nthat kind of thing! I guarantee it! Damn… Why, Sasuke…?! All right! Let’s go! Wait! Sakura! I heard the whole story\Nfrom Lady Hokage. I’m sorry, but I can’t take you along\Non this mission. Even you weren’t able\Nto convince Sasuke, right? All that can be done now is for us\Nto use force to convince him… Sakura, your role in this has ended. Which means, Sakura,\Nthat you and Sasuke…?! Sakura… Naruto… This is a…\Nonce in a lifetime request... Please bring…\Nplease bring Sasuke back. I couldn’t do it!\NI wasn’t able to stop Sasuke! At this point, the only person\Nwho would be able to stop Sasuke… who would be able to save him… is you…Naruto… You like Sasuke so much,\Ndon’t you, Sakura? I understand to my very core how painful it must be\Nfor you right now, Sakura. Sakura, there’s one thing\NI want to ask you. Huh? How do you feel about…Naruto? Thwarting someone’s love seems\Nto have become natural to him. He actually seems to be enjoying\Nmy suffering. Naruto doesn’t understand\Nthe least thing about me. He’s just annoying. Naruto…thank you… I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!\NI promise that on my life! You always understood me… You always helped me… Naruto… Hey, hey, Naruto! You really think you’re gonna be okay\Nsaying that kind of thing?! Sure! I will not go back on my word. That’s my Way of the Ninja! All right! Let’s hurry up and go! We’ve lost a little time…\NLet’s hurry! OK! Naruto struck the pose of\Na nice guy as he said that… It’ll all be all right now. I’m positive…\NI’m positive that it will all go well! Master Sasuke… Around here will do,\Ndon’t you think? We’ve already exited\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. What is that? To tell you the truth, Orochimaru has given us\None important task… So…what is it? It will be necessary for you\Nto die once… Once in a long while, once in a while The remnants of a person\Nbroken by dreams Look like a mountain Clinging to the Divine,\Nclinging to Buddha The remnants of a person crying Look like a mountain Rendezvous with a happy dance circle This is my victory pose, round and around\N (round around) Shake shake shake\NLet’s look With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain From here on up, there's more danger\Nof traps and ambushes. – Stay alert and use all your senses.\N– Roger that! – Find the enemy before he gets you.\N– You can count on me! – And any signs of the enemy--\N– Right!

Umm, where’s the room\Nthat Sasuke’s in? Mr. Sasuke is not allowed\Nany visitors. What?! Hey, hey!\NWhat's up with that?! I’m sorry,\Nthose are the rules. Why, Sis, tell me why? Naruto, this is a hospital.\NKeep it down. Say! Say!\NI've got a favor to ask! You don’t need to say it all. Well, I thought it would\Ncome to this so… I searched for someone\Nto watch your training. Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei! I have some matters\Nto take care of. I don’t have time to\Ntrouble myself with you. Oh! Aha...! You’re going to\Ntrain Sasuke, aren’t you?! Well... don't say that. I found a sensei who’s\Nmore reliable than I am! Well…who is it? It’s me! Huh?! Oh! You! The Closet Perv! Such insolence! Ebisu Returns:\NNaruto's Toughest Training Yet! Ebisu Sensei is\Na Closet Perv? Why’s this guy\Nmy training teacher?! In the first place,\Nhe’s weaker than me! What did you say? But you see! But you see! A long time ago,\Nwith my Harem Jutsu, this guy… Transform! Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu! B-By any chance… Harem Jutsu? U-Uh…it’s nothing! I’ll treat you to and buy you\Nwhatever you want later! Just be quiet about that! You better. Wow, I didn’t know you\Nwere acquainted. Well, they’re unsavory ties, but. How could I ever forget\Nthat humiliation? But why this guy? I definitely don’t want him to. Same here. If it weren’t Kakashi’s favor,\Nwho’d teach you for the fun of it? Then don’t. Now now, both of you… Don’t say that. Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor who teaches the elite,\Na special Jonin! He’s truly better\Nat teaching than I am. Well, Naruto, of the three kids\Nin Squad Seven that I taught, you’re the worst at the basic skills. Get taught with care\Nthis time around. How the heck am I inferior\Ncompared to Sakura and Sasuke?! Naruto, it’s fact that you\Ndon’t have the fundamentals down. No matter what you do,\Nthe basic skills are important. If you really want to become strong,\Njust be quiet and listen to what I say. Now then, Ebisu Sensei,\NI’m leaving him with you. Yes, yes. Dang it. It may appear to be harsh, but you can become stronger\Na lot more. Do your best. Okay, then, let’s go. Still, I’m not convinced… Huh? You see! Fundamentals might be important, but I won’t get strong being taught\Nby someone weaker than me! So in other words,\Nyou want to say that I’m weak? Who else is here?! I was certainly surprised having\Nthat indecent Jutsu used on me that time. But it’s premature for you to\Njudge my ability on just that. Even though you were\Ntotally knocked out. Fine. Then, why don’t we put\Nit to the test? Hmm? Naruto, run. Huh? If you can get to outrun me,\NI’ll back down quietly. Back down…? Yes. And of course, I’ll speak to\NKakashi Sensei about you receiving direct training. What?! Really?! This elite instructor does not\Ngo back on his word. However, this is only if\Nyou can outrun me. Then that makes it easy! See ya! This’ll be a snap, a snap! I’ll lose that…\NCloset Perv in no time! He already can’t catch up! I knew I was quite\Nan exceptional Ninja… Who is exceptional, you say? Surely you’re not thinking you can\Noutrun me with just that much. W-What’re you saying?! The chase has still… only just begun! Though he’s a Closet Perv, he’s the elite tutor after all,\Nhe’s good. Now then. I knew you were Closet Perv. What are you doing…? Naruto? I see. The idea isn’t bad. Then, how about this?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Heh! Catch me…if you can! Not bad… However, you are not the only one\Nwho uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu. I won’t let you get away! Dang it! Son…of…a...! Now then, next. Hold it! I found you! Wait! I won’t let you get away! Get off! There! No, actually, here! Here! There! There! Hold it! Have you reached your limit? You’re freaking pesky! Give it up already! What are you snapping\Nback at me for? This is a chase, so chasing\Nis natural, right? T-True enough… Naruto, you have understood\Nmy greatness by now, right? It’s about time you surrendered\Nand moved on to training-- The heck with that! I’m going to bump you off,\Nand receive Kakashi Sensei’s training! Even if I have to knock you out! It appears you still have\Nsome spirit left. To think he would come at me\Nhead on, even though this is a chase. Just what I would expect of you, Naruto. As Kakashi said, he’s the\Nnumber one unpredictability Ninja. Don’t take this badly! Eat this! Clone Jutsu…? The game is over, Naruto! Dang it! Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles and\Nsalt-flavor ramen noodles! Here you go! Naruto, having been shown\Nyour movements and having further analyzed\Nwhat Kakashi has told me… it is clear that you cannot control\NChakra well. Control…? That’s right. Now then, comparing you\Nwith Sasuke and Sakura … I shall explain your\Nbad points in order. As you know, in the case of using\NNinjutsu, Genjutsu and the like, Ninjas build up Chakra and\Nactivate the Jutsu. I-I know that already! Is that so? Then, in the case of comparing\Nthe three of you, I shall explain specifically\Nhow you are inferior. That’s kind of an irritating\Nway of saying it. I’m treating you the ramen\Nas promised, so be quiet and listen! First, let us say that Sakura\Nuses Clone Jutsu. Clone Jutsu! In her case, her build-up control as well as\Nher control of Chakra is perfect, so she can make clones without\Nusing wasteful energy. Cha! Next, in Sasuke’s case, he is somewhat poor at\Nbuilding up Chakra. Clone Jutsu. But, his control of Chakra is perfect, so both he and Sakura can\Nmake five clones. But, he uses a bit more wasteful\NChakra than Sakura. Oh! So Sasuke’s nothing special. In your case, there’s no time\Nto be laughing at others. Huh? You are very poor at building up Chakra\Nand controlling it, so you cannot make clones\Nwith the same amount of Chakra. In the case where you strain to\Nmake clones despite that, after consuming a much larger amount\Nof Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke… Clone Jutsu! ...you can barely make\None clone at best. By the way, Sakura and Sasuke can become ten\Nwith the same amount of Chakra. Like this, the three of you are\Nthis different even using the same Jutsu. Well, this is a somewhat exaggerated\Ncomparison of you three, but you build up too much Chakra,\Nuse too much physical strength, and your Jutsu activation is also unstable. But, there’ve been times when\NI was greater than Sakura and Sasuke… That’s only because you\Nhappen to have the most outstanding stamina\Nof the three! Well, I am pretty sure that\Nyour Chakra control is getting difficult due to the influence\Nof the Nine-Tails… which is the origin of your stamina. Anyway, there is no mistaking\Nthat you can become strong if you carry out the training\Nwe will be doing from now. Huh?! Really?! I guarantee it. Now then, let’s go. Sir, your bill. Oh, that’s right. Wha--?! Thank you very much! We’ve come quite a long way… But, this is a hot spring town, right? It doesn’t look like we’ve come\Nhere to leisurely soak in a hot spring… Hey! Naruto! That’s the women’s bath! I simply will not allow\Nindecent behavior! Huh? I’m not you… It’s not that I was trying to peep.\NBelieve it! Thinking of something like that\Nin the first place makes you a Closet Perv! What’s with that look? N-Nothing. More importantly, why’ve we come\Nto a place like this?! Will soaking in a hot spring\Ndo anything for training? No! The training will be here\Nin this hot spring area! Okay, this is the place. It’s a bath, sure enough! What are you saying? I said this is training, didn’t I?\NTraining! We’re going to train here? What the heck are we going to do? Walk on this hot water! What?! What is it? Walk on hot water? Can you really do that? Of course! I heard from Kakashi Sensei. You already did tree-climbing training\Nwithout using your hands, right? It’s an application of that. Hmm… 					What do you mean? Besides, I don’t really remember\Nstuff from long ago! In tree climbing, all you do\Nis accumulate only the necessary amount of Chakra\Nin one necessary location and maintain that amount of\NChakra all the while. Trees are fixed objects,\Nso you only need to be attached to it. In other words, it’s training for building up\Na fixed amount of Chakra. To float on the surface of water, you have to discharge on\Na constant basis an appropriate amount of Chakra\Nfrom your feet to the water and balance that to the extent that\Nyou can float your own body. Huh? This Chakra control is\Nmore difficult than maintaining… and is a control training for\Ndischarge and usage of fixed amount of Chakra for Jutsu and alike. Hmm, I really don’t get it! Well, it would be better to\Nshow you in your case. First, you build up Chakra\Nin your feet. Then, while constantly discharging\Na fixed amount… you balance it with your body weight. And… well, this is how it goes. Oh! Okay! 					I’m going to try! First, you build up Chakra\Nin your feet. Then! Discharge a fixed amount. Right? Oh! I knew it. Hot-hot-hot-hot! I forgot to mention it,\Nbut this hot water is 60° C. If you do nothing but fail… you will become a boiled octopus! Dang it! I’ll do it no matter what! You’re unusually spirited today,\Nhonored grandson! My principle of guidance\Nhas finally gotten through! This would ordinarily be the\Ntime to go carry out a surprise attack on Lord Hokage. I’ve stopped doing that now! That’s right! So you have finally understood. That the shortcut to becoming\Nthe Hokage is to do as I say… There are no shortcuts! Huh? Brother Naruto said it… If you’re to become Hokage,\Nbe prepared for that! Oh! I’m starting to get it! To think he would get the\Nhang of the Chakra control this quickly… I never thought,\Nyou would grow this much. Indeed, there are no shortcuts,\Nin anything… It appears I had the\Nwrong idea about you… You are a much smarter teacher\Nthan I am. And, you were not just a Demon Fox… You were a splendid\NHidden Leaf Village Ninja! Oh! Hot! Hm?! That is…! Humph! I don’t know who you are\Nor where you’re from, but… I will not allow indecency!

Well, it’s nonsense, but I thought\NI would at least report it for now. Indeed, we can’t just leave\Nintruders unchecked. Shall we throw them out? No, leave them be. What? It sounds interesting, doesn’t it? They’re going to the trouble of\Ncalling themselves Ninja of this village. But… We probably don’t need to worry. It’s unlikely that anyone could be\Nfooled by such obvious imposters. Come on, please.\NGuy Sensei, Bushy Brow! Pretty please with sugar on top!\NJust the one day today would be fine! Let me join your training! Hey! What’s with this guy\N all of a sudden? He’s probably a real acquaintance\Nof theirs, but… Does he think\Nwe’re going to do training?! I’ll do anything! I’ve always\Nbeen interested in Taijutsu. I mean…okay?! It’s okay, right? Anyway, let’s turn him away! Right! No. Take a pass. What? Why?! Because our training is very harsh,\N rough and difficult. Difficult training, huh…? Ahhh, I’m getting even\Nmore fired up! Please! I won’t get in your way,\Nno matter what! Come on. – Absolutely not!\N– Absolutely not! All right, since it’s come to this! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Real body clones?! – And furthermore…\N– And furthermore… – Harem Jutsu!\N– Harem Jutsu! Wh-What?! – What?! 					– What?! – Pl-ea-se. 					– Pl-ea-se. – Okay! 					– Okay! What?! Yes! – No way. 					– No way. Brother, why’d you say okay? What’s done is done,\Nso it can’t be helped, right?! Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee! What’s the deal, you two? We’re going to the farm today, right? Farm? What’re you doing letting\Nyour mind wander? The person’s waiting.\NCome on, hurry! – Huh? Oh… 					– H-Hey! Hey, wait! – What…? 					– Huh? I promised to plant rice for\Nthe sake of training? Not only that, all of this… It’s totally huge. Gee, thanks. It’s a big help,\Nyou guys giving me a hand. Please don’t worry about it. They accepted this on\Ntheir own accord, so. Bye. Why is this training? I get it! Indeed, I will use my body quite\Na bit if I do this training. So I can get in shape\Nwhile helping out, huh? Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow! I’ll do my best! Why’s he that motivated? Why should we have\Nto do this manual labor…? Damn it.\NAnyway, let’s get this over with! You’re right. Th-That’s mean, brother! Oh, sorry about that. What? Poccha?! Come to think of it, there are\Nflying leeches  in the rice fields, so be careful. F-Flying leeches?! Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly. Yikes. Hey Poccha! Hang in there! Just what I’d expect of Taijutsu training! That was some intense rice planting! Phew, that was a good workout! W-We’re done… Th-That was life or death… Then, shall we move on? – A manure receptacle?!\N– A manure receptacle?! Spread this in that field over there. Th-This is also training…? H-Heavy…Smelly… Why should I have to do\Nsomething like this…? Hey, you guys,\Nwhy don’t you walk straight? Y-You can walk twice\Nthe forward progress distance if you move ahead while\N walking left and right like this! Oh, so that was it? Then I’ll also… Like this? I-It’s really hard to balance like this! D-Damn it! Gee, I didn’t realize at all that\Nthere was a method of training like this… Hey! Watch it.\NWalk more over there… What’d you say? What a nightmare. Forget about it.\NAnyway, let’s lose the kid right now. As for you guys,\Nyou still kind of smell bad. – Shut up! 					– Shut up! There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee. Oh, Sakura. Oh, Naruto. You’re here, too? As for me,\NI’m training together with these two today. R-Really? More importantly, is something up? Yeah… Actually, I really wanted\Nyour help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee. – What? 					– What? – Your laundry blew away in the wind?\N– Your laundry blew away in the wind? That’s right.\Nlt got caught in a bit of a high spot. No. No way, no way.\NWe’ve got lots of work to do, so. Come on! Here I’m asking precisely\Nbecause it’s you guys. Please don’t say no! Sakura, if you’re in that much trouble,\NI could get it for you! Okay, Guy Sensei? Okay?! Sure. What a sheer cliff. That’s for sure. We’d be beyond help\Nif we were to fall from up there. Right? I don’t quite have the confidence… That means… Yup! It’s right above here. Gee, as one would expect,\NI don’t think we could… Isn’t that great, Sakura? For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is\Nno different than a flat path. That’s encouraging. It’s a big help having an awesome Ninja\Nlike you close by, Guy Sensei. What? Uhh… Umm… Now, please. Brother… Damn it. Why is this happening?! I-I don’t want to die. D-Damn it! Hey, as for you guys,\Nwhy aren’t you using the Chakra suction? Th-This is training for building up\Nmuscular strength! So that’s what it was?! Just what I’d expect of a Taijutsu user. I never came up with deliberately\Ndraining physical strength! I really do learn a lot from\Nbeing with you, Sensei. Th-This jerk… I’m…I’m going to die… Alley-oop! No! Th-That was close…! Gee, sorry about that. This jerk… All right, we made it. Don’t look down! Anyway, if we can just take\Nthis back with us… Alley-oop… Damn it… All right, I got it. It won’t come loose…\NHey, help me out here. R-Right… You little…! Sensei, use suction with your Chakra! This is nothing to me! Look out! For real? What?! Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow! I’ve had it… Sensei, Bushy Brow! That was awesome! To do something like not\Nusing Chakra suction. Awesome! – Look you…! 					– Look you…! Perfect timing, you guys. Old Lady Tsunade. Actually, I’ve got something\NI want to ask you guys to do. My companion suddenly started\Nnot feeling well, you see. – Yikes! It’s huge!\N– It's huge! It seems she’s caught a cold. It’s a huge slug. Oh, as for this,\Nis it something like Chief Toad? Well, that sounds about right. However, as you can see,\Nwe can’t carelessly move her. Sorry, but could you guys look\Nafter her for a while? I’m very sorry. Jeez. What a ridiculous guy. Brother, at this rate we won’t be able\N to look for the confidential information. Oh, that’s right. Shut up. What’re you moaning about? You guys. It couldn’t be that you guys can’t listen to the words of me,\Nthe Hokage, could it? – This is the Hokage?\N– This is the Hokage? This is bad. To think the Hokage\Nwas that fierce a person. We’re taking care of\Nher precious companion. We might be able to get into\Nthe Hokage estate surprisingly easily. I wonder. So even Summoning animals\Nget sick, too… It seems to be a light cold. My nose itches, I have a sore throat\Nand I feel weak or something… Hey, I’m going to chill your forehead! Thank you so much. All right, here we go. Oh…Oh no. The itching… What?! – Wha--! 					– What?! It’s… It’s melting… Watch it, you! I’m very sorry. I’ll be more caref-- Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow! You’ll be in danger if you don’t\Nmove away from there! My…My lower back… Y-You idiot! I’m developing my dynamic vision\N for narrowly evading danger! Wha--? That Sensei, he was training, putting his life\Nat risk even at times like this…? Even though that Bushy Brow guy’s\N training properly, as for me…! I’ve woken up,\NGuy Sensei, I’ll train with you! Let’s do this! Ohh, the joints in my body hurt…\NI feel like I’m going to fall apart… Hey! Aren't you a slug?\NWhat’re you doing talking about joints?! – S-Save us. 					– S-Save us! I’ve had it.\NWhat’s going on with this village…? I’ll die if I stay in a place like this\Nany longer. Withdraw… Right. Who’re you guys? Why are you dressed like\Nmy protégé Lee…? Damn it! Since it’s come to this,\N I don’t give a damn anymore! – Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!\N– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack! I don’t really get it, but it seems\N we just have to fight, huh? So it seems. Let’s go, Lee! Now, knockout technique! – Double Dynamic Entry!\N– Double Dynamic Entry! Damn it. What did we go there for\N in the end?! I really hate, I really hate… – the likes of the Leaf!\N– the likes of the Leaf! Tamaya! Lord knows where they came from, but now they’ll probably never\N want to try that again. You sure looked like\Nyou were having fun, Lady Tsunade, going so far as to summon Katsuyu. Well, my adorable Genin\Nhelped out as well, so. Now, we’ve had our breather.\NSo please be getting back to work. Oh yes, ma’am. But still…\NWhat was with that Naruto? To think he seriously believed\Nthose two were for real. What was that all about? Who knows…? Hey! Naruto. – Someone who looked just like me now…\N– Man, you guys got separated. I didn’t know what to do. As for me, I was impressed! – You guys were really cool earlier!\N– Huh? I’ve learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu\Nor something… A lot happened, but I’ll continue\Ntraining right away! Continue training? So come on, let’s continue\Nthe Taijutsu training! Moron, moron, moron. So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here? Even I have times when\NI just don’t understand, baby When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you Even on nights when we’re apart,\NI’ll be close to you I’ll be close to you Damn it! Why should a Ninja have\Nto do something like get rid of a ghost?! We have no choice, right?\NAfter all, a commission is a comission! The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?!\NTh-That’s ridiculous!

209,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands The distance created between us\Nbecame too big, because we were always together Your honest reply, “See you…” coming from that brash mouth\Nmakes it sadder. If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying Then I want to deliver you a smile,\Neven if I’m not by your side Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands I can feel it so close, Our two hearts –Monju. 					–Yes, sir. Darn, didn’t know there was a kid here. I’ll do it. Okay, it’s in your hands, Gantetsu. Okay. Let’s pull out! Set this place on fire! Don’t leave any evidence. The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts Wait up! Over here! You’re it. Try catching me! Darn… –Yeah! 					–This way! This way! I said wait! Lady Tsunade… With regard to the next request… What, there’s more? Yes. Boy oh boy… This is the last one\Nso please try to focus. All right. When the weather continues\Nto be warm like this… And what’s the request? About the escort for the convoy with\Nthe fugitive who was secured… What about it,\Nthat’s hardly a difficult mission. Well, actually there’s a bit\Nof a problem. Please look at this. I see. This is somewhat of\Na nuisance. All of the Jonin are out\Non S-rank missions, and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin\Nhave been allocated elsewhere. Who’s left? Let’s see…well… Multi-Clone Jutsu! Let’s go, Bushy Brows! Here goes, Naruto! Leaf Hurricane! You jerk! Another serving of\NShadow Clones for you! You ain’t seen nothing yet! You let your guard down! Pretty good, Bushy Brow… The same to you, Naruto… Naruto! Lee! Hey, are you guys all right? Hey, stop moving. Sakura, can’t you be\Na little more gentle? Shut your mouth.\NReally, you’re being reckless. That’s not true, Sakura. See, the 100-man\NShadow Clone grapples are excellent training\Nfor enhancing one’s Taijutsu skills. It’s like killing two birds with\None stone for Naruto, too because this kind of friendly training\Nlets him polish his Shadow Clone skills\Nat the same time. That’s exactly right. What are you talking about?\NAll you’re doing is slugging it out. This is what ends up happening\Nwhen two guys get together. That’s right. Anyway, this isn’t the time to be\Nacting carefree like that. Lady Tsunade is calling for you. Grandma Tsunade? What does she want? Ninja Dropouts? Yeah. 					Ninja Dropouts are Rogue Ninja who,\Nof their own free will, choose not to be Shinobi and leave\Ntheir respective villages to join up. They’re a gang of thieves who use brutal\Nand villainous means to steal. That’s horrible…using their abilities\Nas Ninja for criminal purposes. That’s unforgivable. One of their members was\Ncaptured yesterday in Ogi Pass\Nin the Land of Forests. This guy is the only member whose wanted notice is\Ncircling around the lands. He was found wandering about\Nand taken prisoner. His name is Gantetsu. For a former Ninja,\Nthat’s pretty lame. Gantesu is being taken to\Nthe capital city of the Land of Forests in order to do an exhaustive investigation\Ninto this matter for the purpose of wiping out\Nthe Ninja Dropouts… However, there is a possibility\Nthat the Ninja Dropouts will try to rescue him along the way… A police escort has been sent\Nfrom the capital so it is fully prepared for the convoy. But since the opponents are ex-Ninja, the idea is that Shinobi would be\Nthe best countermeasure for Shinobi, so they requested that the Leaf Village\Nalso send out some Ninja. That’s what this request is all about. I’m getting excited! I’ll show ‘em\Nhow great Leaf Ninja are! –Got it!\N–Let’s give it a shot! All right! Naruto Uzumaki,\NSakura Haruno, Rock Lee. The three of you are assigned\Nto the mission of guarding the Gantetsu convoy! –Yes, ma’am! 					–Roger! Look, the harbor. Huh… So they’re gonna\Ntransport him in this. The only way to get to the capital\Nof the Land of Forests is to go up this river. Hey, look over there. That’s… The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu. Are you the Leaf Ninja? Yes. Uh, and who are you? I’m Tsuzumi with the police department. I’m supervising this convoy. My name is Naruto Uzumaki. This guy here’s Bushy Brows and\Nher name is Sakura Haruno. Hmmm… You guys are still kids…\NAre you really Ninja? We sure are. Huh, we might not look it, but we’re all full-fledged Ninja who’ve\Nbeen tested by fire numerous times. We’ll display our skills for you\Nat some point. Just leave it to us. Well, I have a strong team of\Nexperts handling security, but if it ever comes to that, I’m counting on you to use\Nyour specialty, Ninjutsu. Got it. Those are the security personnel\Nguarding the prisoner. They’re all dressed alike, aren’t they? Huh, they don’t have much style. Naruto, that’s rude. Captain Todoroki! What is it, Commander Tsuzumi? These people came from the Village Hidden in the Leaves\Nas reinforcements. The name’s Naruto Uzumaki. I’m Sakura Haruno. My name is Rock Lee. Commander, I told you already. We already have enough security on this. Can’t be helped.\Nlt’s something the bosses decided. There won’t be any role for\Nyou guys to play. We will guard Gantetsu. I promise that on this sword. Huh… That sword’s nothing. Snapping that thing in half would be\Nas easy as apple pie. Yeah, with just one finger. Stop it, you guys!\NPlease excuse them… Be careful not to get seasick. Well, I leave it to you. Y-Yes, sir. Thanks. Gantetsu… All right… Put the cage into the belly of the ship! Okay…Okay… Okay, lower it! Wow… This feels great! What the heck is this anyway? They won’t let us even get near him. They’re totally treating us like nuisances. If only those Ninja Dropout guys\Nwould launch an attack, we could show them how awesome\Nwe are. Don’t say stupid things like that. The best scenario would be that\Nthe Ninja Dropout won’t show up at all. Our mission is to transport Gantetsu\Nsafely to the capital, you know. But this is getting too boring…\Nthere’s no thrill to it. Better just grin and bear it. There are missions like this too. Well, I sure understand\Nhow you feel, Naruto. Yeah… I guess this is getting\Na little boring. Dig in… Gimme a break… Who do those guys think we are? But this stuff is pretty good. Yeah, very tasty. It makes me so mad… I mean, why did we go to all\Nthe trouble of coming all this way? I’m gonna do my mission. Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu. But the captain’s gonna scold you. I’m doing this out of Ninja pride! Uh, Naruto! Naruto! He does have the face of\Na criminal after all. Todoroki? What the heck is he doing here? Akio…! Damn! Father! Mother! Akio… Akio! Damn! Akio…! I will avenge your death right now! Oh! What the heck are you doing?! Are you in your right mind? What was it you were about\Nto do just now?! Ninja Art: Crimson Mud. Oh? What’s the matter, Sakura? Lee, over there. That’s strange… I’ve never knew this river has a tributary. Why are you in here? Why does that matter? What were you about to do to Gantetsu!? What are you talking about? It looked to me like\Nyou were going to kill him. Huh? Me?\NThat’s a stupid thing to say. It’s my mission to guard this guy.\NWhy would I?! Yeah, I guess. Even if he is a criminal, you can’t just kill him off\Nwithout interrogating him first. A brat talking like he knows, huh? There isn’t any need to interrogate him! This is the guy who did it! Huh? This guy… These guys…slaughtered a lot of people\Nwithout mercy… Even innocent children. If things continue like this,\Nwe’ll be sucked into the tributary… What should we do?! Ninja Art: Link and Slay. What the heck?! Wh-What is this? Th-The ship’s been sliced in half… Naruto! Naruto! You jerk! It’s them! The Ninja Dropouts! So they showed up after all… Gantetsu… Reinforcements, huh?! Hey, who are you guys anyway! The head of the Ninja Dropouts,\NShura, on the scene! Ninja Dropouts… We’ll take Gantetsu… I’m not about to let that happen! The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Lee, are you all right? Yes, somehow.\NMore importantly, what happened? I don’t know. Only thing I know is that after\Nthat huge crash, suddenly the ship was sliced in two… I see.

5,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart You have to think when using Jutsu. They can be used against you. Also, don't get caught\Nin an obvious trap, you fool. A Ninja must see\Nthrough deception…got it? I know that! You know, you say that because\Nyou don't get it. Listen up. Your movements are wasteful. Now! He finally dropped his guard! You're so... No way! You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it. Damn! Another substitution…? He must have found out my location\Nwith those Shuriken! He purposely lowered his guard!\NServes me right… I fell for the trap. So he's over there, eh… Sasuke…Where are you…?! Don't tell me,\NKakashi Sensei already… No! That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?! Safe! He didn't notice me. Sakura, behind you. Huh?! What's up with that ""A Ninja must see\Nthrough deception"" stuff?! Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again! I fell for it again! You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision What was that?! Huh?! Hold on! Where's Sensei?! Huh?! What's going on?! Huh?! What's what?! Sakura… Sasuke?! Sa…Saku…ra… P-Please…help…me… Maybe I went a bit overboard… But it's really something\Nshe should notice… Was that voice…Sakura's…? Shinobi Battle Skill ♪2, Genjutsu. Sakura was easily lured. Genjutsu, huh...? An illusory mind-controlling technique.\NI'm not surprised she got lured. However… I'm different from them. Why don't you say that after\Nyou get a bell…Sasuke? It's no use just using\Nstraightforward attacks. A trap?! What?! This guy's...?! What a guy. There's no time\Nto read ""Make-Out Paradise."" What…? 					I…?! That's right! I saw Sasuke on\Nthe verge of dying and I… Sasuke!\NDon't die and leave me here!! Where are you?! So that's what it looks like\Nbehind the logs. Oh! There are box lunches on the stone! A Ninja must see through deception... eh? Well! I'll acknowledge that\Nyou're different from those two. Horse! Tiger! Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu! What?! That's not a Jutsu\Nthat a Genin can do… He shouldn't have\Nenough Chakra yet! He's gone!\Nls he behind me?! No, above me?! Where is he?! I'm under you!! Wha--?! Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu. Shinobi Battle Skill ♪3, Ninjutsu. How's that? You can't move, heh? Although, you're…already starting\Nto make your mark. But, oh well. They do say that the nail that sticks up\Ngets hammered down, so… Damn it! I don't have to naively take those bells.\NI'll just eat in secret right now! Let's eat!! Hey. I was just joking… Too late! Darn it…! Is there this much of\Na difference in strength…? Sakura... This time it's a freshly severed head?! What's up with her? Sasuke? You're okay! Hey, cut it out!\NDon't cling to me! There's not much time left until noon.\NI'm going. Sasuke, you're still going\Nafter the bells?! I was able to touch them last time.\NNext time I'll be able to take them. What?! 					I-I see. Sure enough,\Nyou're awesome, Sasuke. There's no way I can take\Nthe bells from Sensei. At this rate, I'll face\Nseparation from Sasuke… Uh…say. There's really no time left… So let's just take it easy and\Ntry again next time. I'm the only one\Nwho can kill that man. Huh…? What?\NYou mean Sensei? At that time…I was crying. Crying…? My… What…? What is it…? I'm an avenger. I must become stronger\Nthan that man… I don't have time for setbacks here... ...to kill a certain man! Damn it…I wasted my time talking. Sasuke... Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling… By the way, about this exercise… Well! There's no need for you guys\Nto go back to the Academy. What? I… All I did was lay unconscious. Is that okay? Love is victorious!! Cha!! Yahooooo! Then, then!\NThat means the three of us… Yes. The three of you… must quit being Ninja!! N-No way! Kakashi hasn't passed\Na single person this whole time… Iruka… Even I don't know if it's good for\Nthose kids to become Shinobi right away… However…\NKakashi's judgments were correct… Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?! Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to\Ntake the bells. But why do we have to be told to ""quit""?! That's because you're all squirts who\Ndon't have the qualifications to become Ninja. Oh! Sasuke! I'm saying you're squirts. Don't step on Sasuke!! Are you kids thinking that\Nbeing a Ninja is easy? Huh? Why do you think you're doing\Nthis exercise in teams? Huh?! What do you mean? Put simply… it's as if you guys have no\Nunderstanding of the answer to this test. Answer…? Yes. The answer that determines\Npassing or failing of this test. That's…what I've wanted to ask\Nabout for a while now. Man, are you guys brainless or what? Don't you get the meaning of\Nthe three-man squad?! Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?! That's…teamwork! You mean, working together? Exactly. But it's too late even\Nif you realize that now. You might've been able to… take the bells if the three of you\Nhad come at me… Well, it's too bad. Now wait a minute. Why use teamwork if\Nthere were only two bells? If the three of us were to desperately go\Ntake the bells with one having to hold back, that wouldn't be teamwork.\NThat'd create internal discord. Of course! This is a test set up to purposely\Nplace you against each other. It's under just such conditions\Nwhere one's own interests aren't the issue. The intention was to select those\Nwho could prioritize teamwork… Despite this, you fools… Sakura! You were only concerned with Sasuke and\Nyou didn't even know where he was. And you didn't care for Naruto who was\Nright in front of your eyes… Naruto! All you do is run solo… You labeled the other two as hindrances\Nand acted on your own… Missions are carried out in squads! There's no mistaking that Ninjas need\Nunsurpassed individual skills… But ""teamwork"" is considered\Nmore important than that. Individual actions that disrupt teamwork\Nthrow the team into crisis and lead to death… For example... ""Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies…"" What?! What?! Whaaat?! Is what will…happen. Oh, I was so surpised. On top of having a hostage taken, you're faced with two impossible choices\Nand end up being killed. Every mission is\Na life-risking assignment. Look at this… The many names engraved\Non this stone… These are all Ninjas who are called\Nheroes in the village. That-that-that-that! I like thaaat! I've decided now to get\Nmy name engraved there, too! A hero! A hero!\NI'm not going to die like a dog! But…they're not just ordinary heroes. No kidding. Then, what kind\Nof heroes are they? Hey! Hey! They are heroes\Nwho were killed in action. Killed in action? It means they died\Nperforming a mission. This is a memorial. The names of my friends\Nare also engraved here... I'll give you guys one more chance! However, after noon it'll be\Na harsher battle to take the bell. Those who want to take on\Nthe challenge can eat lunch. However, don't let Naruto have any. It's punishment for breaking the rules and\Nattempting to eat lunch on your own. If someone lets him eat… that person will be disqualified\Non the spot. I make the rules, here. Got it?! I must be going. Listen to me, Iruka. What? No matter what the result,\Ndon't hold it against Kakashi… Alright. I'm okay with not eating lunch!\NNo sweat at all! No sweat… Here. H-Hey, Sasuke.\NSensei just said…! It's okay.\NThere's no sign of him now. The three of us are going to go\Ntake the bells together. It'll be trouble for me\Nif he becomes a hindrance, so... Sasuke… Sakura… Thanks… Don't thank me.\NJust hurry up and eat. But… I'm on…a diet…\NI mean I just eat less than Sasuke. So you don't need to worry. But… See… Wha--?! Hurry it up.\NWe don't know when he'll be back… It's just this one time. Okay? You got it?! I got it. You three! Yiiikes! You defied the rules so that\Nmeans you know what's coming… Do you have…something to say? But you see… What?! But! But! But!\NYou said, Sensei! These guys… We're a three-man squad, right? That's right!\NThe three of us are one, so…! That's right! That's right!\NThat's right! That's right! The three of you are one, eh… You pass! What?! Whaaat?! You pass! We passed?! Why?! You guys are the first. Up until now, it was always just dunces\Nwho would meekly listen to what I said. A Ninja must see through deception… In the world of Ninja, those who break rules and codes\Nare branded as garbage… But… Those who don't cherish their friends are\Ngarbage worse than that. He's… He's…kinda…cool… That's it for the exercise… Everyone passes! Group Seven starts their mission\Ntomorrow! Yes, Sir! I did it!! I'm a Ninja!\NNinja! Ninja! Let's go home. Cha!

153,"Hey boys, listen up! Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something A Lesson Learned!\N                               The Iron Fist of Love Please don’t die…\NI’ll get you out now. Hey! What are you doing there? Curry of Life Shop One, two… 					One, two… Hope they’re all right. I’m sure they’ll be able\Nto bring Karashi back. Definitely, Definitely. One, two… That’s the Katabami Gold Mine… Instead of just getting\NRokusuke and Karashi back, let’s finish the Kurosuki Family\Nonce and for all! Don’t get carried away, Naruto. So, what are we gonna do then? I’m kind of worried about\Nwhat Guy Sensei told us. The boss of the Kurosuki Family\Nmay be one of the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist. Who knows what\Nthey’ll do to Rokusuke? Yeah, but how seriously\Ncan we take Guy Sensei’s info? What are you talking about?!\NGuy Sensei is always right! Calm down, Lee.\NWe should investigate first. Yeah! Sir Raiga, we were able\Nto capture Rokusuke, one of the three that\Nslipped out of the village. Well done. It seems that they went to ask\Nfor some help from a Ninja village. Where did you go?! I’m sorry. Don’t bother, rookie. Yes sir! Rokusuke, I thought we had\Na good relationship with everybody in the Gold Mine. Well, that’s… Why is it? I’m so deeply sorry\Nto hear that you left the village. I can’t remember how things\Nwere in the past, when everything was going well. I’m sorry, I’m sorry.\NI won’t do it again! Yeah, I have a good idea. I’m going to arrange\Nfor your funeral. Please don’t! Please let me go! I won’t do it again,\Nso please forgive me! Why? Don’t you like funerals? No, I don’t wanna die yet! You know, I really like funerals… Think about it. When they are alive, humans speak ill\Nof each other, they betray each other,\Nand they hate each other. But at a funeral, they forget all the hatred\Nthey had for the other. They even remember\Nthe good times they had together. Right? You have to be kidding me!\NNo! Please don’t do it. Hey! Let me go! It’s a done deal then.\NLet’s have a big funeral for Rokusuke. – Yeah! 					– Yeah! Come on! Hurry up! Is that gold?\NThere’s nothing shiny about it. They have to melt\Nthat ore into mercury. After that they evaporate it\Nand only then does it turn into pure gold. I don’t get it. Well, there is no need\Nfor you to understand it. Oh! Huh? What are you doing?!\NHurry up! If you don’t hurry up, I’m gonna ask the boss\Nto let me hold your funeral! Please forgive me! I’m getting really mad now.\NI won't forgive them! Calm down, Naruto… We don’t know anything\Nabout them yet. That’s right. We should do\Nwhat Neji is telling us. Yeah but… if we don’t do something,\Nthat poor old guy is going to die! Naruto, leave things to me here. Wait, Lee! Hey, hey.\NHurry up and pick them up! Yeah! Way to go, Lee! Are you okay, old man? Oh my gosh!\NWhat have you done?! Here. Drink some water. What are you doing?! I beg you.\NPlease punch me, kick me. Please knock me around like the way you just did\Nwith those guys. What are you saying? If you won’t do it,\NI’ll do it myself! What are you doing?! Stop! I’m scared. Just think what they’ll do if they knew I was\Nthe only one that was safe. What was that sound? Did they find us? Oh my, that’s the sound\Nof the funeral bell. Funeral? Yeah. Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family\Nwhich rules this town, arranges a funeral for\Nthose who betray him. He buries them alive. What? They bury them alive?\NThat’s so cruel! Yeah but… Raiga always cries sadly\Nduring the funeral. That’s one weird guy. But… That doesn’t seem to be\Nthe sound of the bell for you. Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke\Nwas caught this morning, so… What?! I’m so happy, I remember\Nthe first day I met that guy. Yeah? That’s nice. Yeah… When I told him we were taking\Nover the mountain from the magistrate, he was so relieved to be freed from\Nthe high taxes that he was paying. He was laughing out of pure joy…\NHe was a really nice guy. I like funerals.\NMakes me feel nostalgic. Would you put on\Na big funeral for me too? Fool! I’m not putting on\Na funeral for you. You are not going\Nto die before me. I don’t have to have a funeral for you\Nto think of the good times because you are always a good boy. Raiga. What is it? They're coming.\NThey’ll show up anytime now. Yeah… I’m excited to see\Nwhat kind of help he sought. Okay! Let’s save the guy. Let’s do it, Neji. Okay. Byakugan! It’s all right. He’s still alive. If we can get rid of\Nthe guys around him, we can save him. Okay! Let’s get rid\Nof them quickly! Yeah! Okay, let’s go! No…! Let me out! An enemy attack! You…! Tenten, you take the right! Okay! Gentle Fist! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Na-ru-to… Uzumaki Barrage! That’s the way! – Watch out! 					– Huh? There are three more! Here comes the Leaf Village's\NHandsome Devil, Rock Lee! I found the last one! You are… Who is this guy? Well… This is Karashi. The one Grandma Sansho\Nwas talking about… This is Karashi? Karashi, was it your own decision\Nto join the Kurosuki Family… just like Grandma Sansho said it was? So what if it was? What?! Sir Raiga is great! He dethroned the old evil government\Nof the Katabami Gold Mine, and he liberated everybody\Nfrom the village! One, two, one two… One, two, one two… Umm, Grandma… Oh my… 					You are so greedy! They are fighting their lives\Nout there by going into the gold mine… Can’t you just wait at least\Nwhile I’m cooking the curry? I don’t mind waiting but…\NI think something is burning. What? Oh my, oh my… Oops… Yeah, it burned… Karashi, did you know that Grandma Sansho worries about you\Neveryday while cooking curry? Naruto, leave things to me here. Karashi, you saved my life\Nwith your curry of life. If you can make such\Na wonderful curry, how can you stay with the family of\Na man with no respect for life?! Why? Nobody cares to compliment me\Neven if I can make that curry. As a man born in this world, I should gain more power and\Ntry to take over the world! Instead of sitting around in that store\Nthat no one patronizes anymore. What? I can’t take this anymore! Lee! Karashi, not only did you and\NGrandma Sansho’s curry save my life… But you also taught me that\Nif you make it from the heart, just one serving of curry\Ncould save lives, and that even somebody like me\Ncould do anything just by trying hard. You looked much stronger\Nand dignified then than you do now. Karashi! I’ve never seen anybody\Nwho tries this hard. I see. You want to save\Nthis boy too, huh… Please promise me…\NPlease get out of the Kurosuki Family! You're right… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry! Oh, I’m so relieved. Hey! Please get me out of here. It’s dark and I can’t breathe. Oh yeah! We almost forgot\Nabout Rokusuke. Mmm? You guys… Sorry to keep you waiting.\Nlt’s all right now. I’m sorry. Thinking that maybe I could still save my friend\Nwho got buried alive… I just couldn’t stay still. Yeah, I understand. Neji, what is it? What is this? This feeling of danger… Hey Neji, what is it? We are being watched.\Nlt’s probably Raiga. What? From the top of that cliff… Okay. Let’s go! Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke. All right. No one’s here. Where did he go? Mmm? What is that? This mist… Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu! Hidden Mist Jutsu…\NA specialty of Mist Village Ninja. So, what Guy Sensei said was true? Damn, I can’t see anything! Neji, try to find the enemy\Nwith your Byakugan. I’ve been trying…! Uh…Can’t see a thing! That’s impossible.\NEven Neji’s Byakugan that’s supposed to let him\Nsee 360 degrees won’t work! What’s going on? There isn’t supposed to be\Na Jutsu that can break Byakugan! What do you think, Ranmaru? It’s amazing… One of them can see through\Nthe Chakra Network. He probably has some sort\Nof Kekkei Genkai power. He can see us? It’s all right,\Nmy power is superior to his… So, what are you going to do? Everybody in the Katabami\NGold Mine is depending on me. I’m the one who has to\Nkeep the peace of this village. Are you going to hold a funeral? No, even if I hold a funeral,\NI have no memories of them. I’ll just get rid of them! Look,\NNinja Art: Lightning Fang! Wh-What is it?! Lighting! Drop! What do you think, Ranmaru? It’s great, Raiga! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah Naruto Barrage! What? Leaf Hurricane! Mm? Here I come! Huh? Impossible! Hey! The enemy disappeared! I have nobody either! What? There is no enemy! Neji! Are you using\Nyour Byakugan correctly?! I am doing it right!

The one Hayate was following\Nwas likely a Sound spy called Kabuto… Well, it’s certain that Orochimaru\Nis trying to do something but… So…we’ll cancel Chunin Exam\Nand go after Orochimaru…?! No, he revealed his identity to Anko… sending us a threat not to cancel. Not to cancel the Chunin Exam for which all of the Ninja of\Nthe Alliance have gathered! What does it mean? Orochimaru possesses enough power\Nto take down a small Land on his own. He’s a Ninja that probably\Nevery land has eyes on. Moreover, he conveniently holds\Na grudge against this Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves. Any Land would desire him. So could it be… that any Land in the Alliance\Nwould unite with Orochimaru and betray the Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves?! Well, the Alliance Treaty is at\Nthe same level as a verbal agreement! As was in the former Great Ninja War… In any case, there’s too little information\Nright now. Let’s end these unnecessary\Nsuspicions. We’ve already dispatched Anbu, the black ops to each Land\Nto collect information. It’s dangerous to act carelessly… That could be what the enemy\Nis aiming for. And also… I trust all of you! When the time comes, we’ll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf\NVillage together and simply fight! At that time… Be quiet about this bruise! Should I have stopped him forcefully…? No visitors…? That’s correct.\NI’m sorry but… I know he’s been hospitalized,\Nbut no visitors…?! What’s going on? We’re also not aware of the details so… There’s no use worrying about it here. Huh?

As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain I’ll give it to you straight… Your next mission was commissioned\Nby a certain Feudal Lord’s daughter. You are to act as her double. I don’t know where she heard about you, but you apparently bear\Na striking resemblance to the princess. Therefore she requested\Nthat you be the one who carries it out… A double…? Is someone targeting the princess? Well, if anything,\Nshe’s the one who’s doing the targeting… Huh? Not to worry. You’re already an admirable\NHidden Leaf Shinobi. Furthermore, I’ve arranged for you\Nto have an assistant. Assistant? Grandma Tsunade!\NYou have a mission for me? And one from a Feudal Lord to boot! Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade! Sorry, but all the other guys\Nare too busy. Just me and this guy? Yup.\NDo your best to carry out the mission. The client is\Na Feudal Lord’s daughter, huh… Wow… I guess that means that\NI’ve finally became good enough to handle amazing missions\Nlike this, huh?! Hey, don’t get too excited. Terrible things happen\Nwhen you're like that. I know…\NJust leave things in my capable hands! You’re really a piece of work… Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise! Thank you for coming from afar. That’s the client? She and Ino really do look alike, but… I-It’s a bit of a stretch… It’s all right.\NI have an idea of what you wish to say. My physique doesn’t really resemble\Nthat of the double there… That’s what you’re thinking, right? – Oh…not at all… Umm…\N– To be honest, – I don’t think you resemble her at all.\N– Hey! Well, I don’t blame you for thinking that.\NBut here, have a look at this! T-That’s…lno! That’s what I looked like\Na short time ago… Truth be told, I only got like this after it was decided that\NI was to have an arranged courtship. An arranged courtship?! The other party is Master Chikara\Nfrom the neighboring Land of Udon. Ever since I saw his picture, my feelings for him\Nhave deepened day by day. And as the day\Nof the arranged courtship grows closer, I have become increasingly nervous,\Nmy cheeks have been flushed, and my heart has been pounding. I can’t even sleep at night. And because of that stress,\NI’ve started overeating… It goes without saying that\Nyou’ll get fat if you pig out. Of course,\NI’ve taken appropriate countermeasures! I’ve been using something that cuts all\Nthe fats and carbohydrates that I ingest… ""Easy-Peasy Slim Special” It didn’t work, did it? I placed too strong hopes in it… How can I possibly have\Nan arranged courtship with the man I’m infatuated with\Nwhen I look like this? So that’s my situation…\NNow, let’s get to the main issue. I want you to attend\Nthe arranged courtship in my place and make it a success at any cost. Huh?! 					So this double thing is just to act on you behalf\Nat some arranged courtship?! What do you mean by\N“some arranged courtship”?! I mean, when you talk about doubles,\Nyou thinks of situations where someone’s life is in danger\Nand that sort of thing. What are you talking about?! The princess’s entire life is at stake!\NThis is major! Oh! So you understand a heart in love… I sure do…\NA girl always wants to look cute for the guy she loves. Even if she’s a fake…? It can’t be helped.\NI mean, guys prefer slender girls. That’s exactly right! I’m counting on you. Sure thing! Leave it to me! But even if\Nthe arranged courtship goes well… The gap is just too big. I’ll just have to lose weight\Nby the day of the wedding. I already have a plan in place for that. This supplemental type diet food,\N“Supplement Slender”! If I supplement all three meals with this… Why don’t you draw on the lessons\Nyou’re supposed to have learned…? In any case, I’ll use my charms to make\Nthis arranged courtship a success! This annex is where\NI often played in my childhood. I plan to use this to listen in on\Nthe arranged courtship from here. Huh… That’s pretty convenient. I would love to meet him in person\Nif I could, but… Hey, is he that cool looking? Of course he is! He’s someone with\Nsomething really special about him! Well then,\Njust make sure he falls for you. Leave it to me! I thought you weren’t motivated… Well, this is a mission after all. So I think I’ll pull myself together\Nand hustle! Don’t do anything unnecessary, okay! W-What’s up? The sound is getting closer! – What? 					– It’s so bright! There are many a handsome man\Nin this world, but this man is\Nrenowned even among them! This man makes\NLand of Udon what it is… that sexy man\Nwith glistening sidelong glances! The oh-so-great young prince Chikara… Kneel down and bow before him! Sorry. It appears that\NI have kept you waiting, princess You're…Master Chikara? He’s even more intense than\Nlntense-Brow Sensei. I’m sorry, pretty girl. I have constitutional low blood pressure. Dunno. He looks more like\Nhe has high blood pressure to me… What? D-Do you always scatter\Nflower petals? Flowers are wonderful. They truly allay the fatigue\Nof your mind and your body. Don’t you find them relaxing? I-I guess… Okay then, next… Hey, don’t you think\Nhe’s different from her description…? I mean, he’s fa… Fa…?! Stop! These sweets are really fabulous,\Naren't they? Do excuse us a little. What the heck are you doing,\Nout of the blue like that?! It’s women’s intuition. I got the same vibe from him as Choji. That word is probably taboo. Oh, I see! Gimme a break! What’s up with that uselessly\Nintense chubby guy showing up when she told us\Nhe’d be a handsome prince?! But wouldn’t his physique\Nbe a perfect match for her? I’m sure there must be some mistake. There’s no way a girl\Nwould fall in love with a guy like that. But maybe that’s\Nthe princess’ taste in men… That’s impossible. I mean… He’s flashy…! Intense…! And a fatso! He’s a freak! A freak! There’s gotta be a mistake!\NI’m sure of it! Y-You think so? What are you saying? There’s no mistake that that’s\NMaster Chikara, the man of my heart. I thought so… What an elegant man… I deeply regret that I cannot see him\Nup close with my very own eyes. I guess one could say that everybody\Nhas their own set of woes. Listen, make sure that\Nhe takes a liking to me no matter what! Stop complaining and get the ball rolling\Nwith dogged persistence! I will convey that to her. Has you tension not eased?\NMusic is good for relaxation. Please, you need not go to the trouble… – What did she say?\N– She said there’s no mistake. She wants you to bulldoze on ahead! I can’t believe it! It’s our mission, you know! I know that… Princess Fuku…do you like roses? Yes…very much so… Great! 					I love roses too! In the language of flowers,\Nthey signify love! But don't their meanings\Ndiffer depending on their color? For example, yellow roses are\Nsupposed to mean “Let’s break up”… It’s nonsense to discriminate\Nbecause of color… I mean the flowers\Nare not at fault, after all. For you. Hey…wait! Huh? I can’t do it! I can’t do it! There’s no way!\NHe’s too intense. There’s no way I can act as\Na substitute for the princess! Calm down.\NStop saying that and do your best. Nope.\NI just can’t stand him physically. Oh, I got it. If you just think of him – as a somewhat intense Choji…\N– Choji has fat on him for the sake of his Ninjutsu… I don’t have the slightest idea\Nwhat purpose that prince’s fat serves. That’s a pretty severe opinion,\Nyou know… I’m going off somewhere for a moment. Huh? Hey, where are you going?! Gimme a break, that girl’s a handful… Well, this is for the sake of\Na mission after all. I guess it’s about time for Naruto\Nto lend a helping hand! What is it?! I’m not judging you, but I think you\Nshould pass on that young prince. There’s something wrong with his head.\NI’m positive! What are you saying?\NHe’s a passionate and wonderful man! But… I hired the Leaf to\Nprovide me with substitute for the arranged courtship\Nand bring it to success. You’re a professional Shinobi, right? So I suggest you get on it\Nand get the job done! The atmosphere in there\Nhasn’t been very congenial at all! You need to be aggressive\Nin making yourself appealing to him! I’m sorry to have\Nkept you waiting, Chikara! That’s right!\NJust like that…huh? That jerk…! H-Hey! P-P-Princess? Master Chikara… Could you loosen\Nmy sash for me, please? But…but… Please. Oh my gosh! There’s a creepy-crawler up here\Nunder the roof that looks like a sow bug! Mind Destruction Jutsu! A creepy-crawler\Nthat looks like a sow bug? An insect? Oh…she vanished… What the heck are you thinking?! Where is the princess? I don’t know. She vanished… What is going on anyway? This is starting to irritate me…\NI can’t get what’s happening from here. Why are you meddling!\NI was just one step away! What do you think you’re doing,\Ndressed up like Princess Fuku?! I’m telling you! In one of Pervy Sage’s books\Nhappened to glance at, this is the kind of thing that worked. I don’t believe that anyone would\Nuse such a garish advance! That’s dirty! There’s absolutely no way\Na type of guy like you would ever be mistaken for\Nthe protagonist of a boy’s comic! Huh! I was doing a way better job\Nthan you were! Gimme a break… Now that things have come to this, I need to take care of business\Nbefore another meddler gets in the way! Huh… You gotta be kidding… It looks like my help is needed\Nif this mission is going to be a success. Princess…\Nwhere in the world have you been? Please forgive me. I was so nervous\NI just flew into a panic earlier on… You really seemed like\Na totally different person. I’m so sorry. You were such a wonderful person,\Nthat it became almost unbearable… Non.

That can’t be… Impossible. INNER INO 							Naruto…! But I’m very moved that\Nyou have such deep feelings for me that you actually saw a vision… Vision? No, I definitely saw… You mustn’t look! P-Princess? Damn…I did that without thinking… Oh goodness me… In my ardent desire for\Nyou to look just at me, I… What intense passion… All right…\NAs you wish, princess. – Huh? 					– Allow me to catch those hot feelings in fine style! Could this be…? Come, don’t hold back. Huh?! You may not kiss him!\NNo kisses! Oh! Goodness, you cannot\Nbe too careful these days! Who told you that you could\Ngo as far as kissing him?! Oh, it’s not that I wanted to… I’d have to say that\Nyou actually came to my rescue. Don’t bandy words with me! Listen carefully, holding hands is\Nas much as I can concede to you…! You’re too loud! The princess vanished again. – Princess! 					– Princess! This isn’t good!\NI better hurry back. Don’t try anything funny in there! I know that! In any case, we can’t let him\Nsee the two of us together! Hurry back to your room, Princess! All right. Gimme a break that Ino… Dumping me in the lake like that.\NThanks to her I’m freezing! This is bad! I gotta pee…\NGotta go! I don’t know where\Nthe toilet is around here. There’s nobody around…\NWell, it is an emergency situation after all. Huh?! W-W-What the heck do you think\Nyou’re doing over there looking like me?! No…this is…um… How shameless!\NStop that immediately! I can’t stop it… Do you not understand that\NI’m telling you to stop! It’s impossible to stop so sudden! Hey! Wait up! I wasn’t quite\Nemotionally prepared earlier on… However, the feelings I have\Nfor you in my heart are true. Princess… Master Chikara… I have harbored a secret love for you\Nfor a long time. Please, take me… Huh? – I wonder what that sound is?\N– I have no idea… Rain? What a beautiful rainbow… Stop, I say! I told you, it’s impossible! Ouch! Princess?! Naruto! You idiot! Forgive me for this one, please! I won’t forgive you! Look what you’ve done! Ouch… Stop! What in the world is going on?! Oh no!… 					Umm…this is, well… All right, that’s enough…\NWe can't fake it any longer. I apologize for having hoodwinked you.\NI am…the bona fide Fuku. You mean to say that\Nthe princess up to now was an imposter? That is correct. What is the meaning of all this? I wouldn’t have imagined that\Nthings would come to such a finale! No, that’s not correct, Master Chikara! Out of my way! The super body I fantasized about\Nin my dreams! My ideal personified! Bravo! – Huh? 					– Huh? My cute princess. Please marry me! I’m delighted, Master Chikara! Hail the future wife! What is this anyway…? Somehow it seems like our mission\Nturned out to be success in the end… I think? Could it be? I put all my efforts\Nin making advances on a guy who’s not my type in the least\Nand got rejected. Moreover,\Nit was a totally wasted effort… Is that what happened? But, everything turned out well.\NSo isn’t it okay? And both of them look so happy together… That’s not the problem!\NA damsel’s heart has been wounded… I can’t believe that, of all things,\NI was brushed off by a guy like that… He didn’t even glance in your direction\Nat the end there. Stop it! Don’t remind me. You can never knows\Nwhat a person likes, can you? Nope…\Nthere’s no way I’ll acknowledge that! A man’s got to like a slender girl better!

27,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. I like your determination! Then… For those who are still here… The first test... you have passed it! You’ve passed through the gates! The first test for the Chunin Exams\Nhas been completed… I wish you well. All right! Wish us well! What a funny guy… Huh… I didn’t think that there would be\Na guy who would pass the first test with a blank test sheet. Naruto Uzumaki.\NHe really is a funny guy. The Chunin Exam Stage 2:\NThe Forest of Death! There’s something kind\Nof creepy about this place. This place is called the Forest of Death,\Nyou’ll soon realize why. “The Forest of Death,\Nyou’ll soon realize why.” That kind of threat won’t work\Non me one bit! I’m not scared! Really? You’ve got a lot of energy. A kid like you dies at very beginning, dappled with the red blood I like. I’m returning your…Kunai Knife… Thank you for taking the trouble… But…don’t stand behind me,\Nthirsty for blood. If you don’t want a quick death… Well, it’s my nature to act up\Nat the sight of red blood. And my precious hair was cut,\Nso I got excited… Naruto… I’m sorry… W-What with that Proctor? Frankly, she’s psycho! This one, too… That girl, why was her tongue so long? Evidently, we’ve got\Na lot of hot-blooded kids this time. This will be fun. You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it! Well, before we start the second exam,\NI have to pass this out to you! It’s a consent form, before you can take part\Nin the test you have to sign this. Why? From here on out,\Ncorpses are going to come out, I have to get your consent to that! Or it’ll be my responsibility. Well, I’m going to start\Nthe explanation for the second exam. In a word, the limits of\Nyour survival will be challenged. Survival, huh?\NThis test is a total pain. First, I’ll give you step-by-step instruction\Non the terrain of this Training Field. Training Field Number 44 is surrounded\Nby 44 locked entrance gates, there are rivers and a forest\Nand a tower in the middle. It’s about 10 kilometers\Nfrom the towers to the gate… In this confined area, you will\Ngo through a certain survival program. The contents of which are… anything goes scroll battle! Scroll…? Yes… I want you to fight for two scrolls,\Nthe Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll. All together 26 teams got\Nthrough the first test. Half of them... 13 teams get the Heaven scroll,\Nthe other half get the Earth Scroll. I’ll hand over one scroll to each team. To put it simply,\N that’s what you’re vying for. And the conditions to pass? Three of you bring both the Heaven and\NEarth Scrolls to the tower in the center. That means that of the 13 teams,\Nhalf of them will fail for sure… Except it has to be in time. For this second exam,\Nthe time limit is 120 hours. Do it in exactly five days! Five days. What do we do about food? Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trove\Nin the wilderness. There’s more than enough for food… However… It’s teeming with\Nfierce people-eating animals, poison bugs, poisonous weeds and\Nmuch more. No way… Fool, that’s why it’s called survival! Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people,\N13 teams will pass. The interval for activity gets longer\Nwith passing each day, while the time for recovery\Ngets shorter… Seems pretty grueling! On top of that, you’re surrounded\Nby nothing but enemies, even falling asleep\Nwill be a problem… And, besides those injured\Nduring attempts to capture scrolls… there will definitely be people are unable to endure\Nthe rigors of the course. Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it? According to the rules,\Nyou cannot give up in the middle of it! I want you to spend\Nfive days in the forest. Just like I thought… This is going to be a pain! Moving on, conditions of disqualification. Number 1, if all three members\Nof the team can’t make it to the tower with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls\Nwithin the time limit. Number 2, if a team loses a member\Nor if a member became incapacitated. There’s that, and this is a supplement… Absolutely do not look at\Nthe contents of the scrolls until you have reached the tower! W-What happens if we look\Nat it halfway through? When you look at it you’ll find…out! Huh? There are times when a Chunin\Nmust deal with super-secret text. This is to test your reliability. That’s all the explanation! I’ll exchange your three consent forms for\Nthe scrolls in that hut over there. After that, pick your entrance,\Nand all the gates will open simultaneously! Finally, just a word of advice… Don’t die! I see, so you won’t know which\Nscroll was given to each team… and you won’t know which of\Nthe three people is carrying the scroll. If what Ibiki said was right, there will be life or death\Nstruggles for information in this test. Everyone is an enemy! The resolve of everyone here is strong. That means that it might come\Nto killing each other. It looks like they understand the meaning\Nof the consent form a little bit… Heeey, look who’s here! It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it? I thought you went home long ago,\NI never imagined you were still here. Ooooh? Look who’s here,\Nthe ugly Inopig. Starting now, it's five days of\Nthe survival test with Sasuke. There’s no reason to go home. – Ugly! 					– Billboard! – Ugly! Ugly!\N– Billboard! Billboard! – Ugly, ugly, ugly!\N– Billboard, billboard, billboard! – Billboard, billboard, billboard!\N– Ugly ugly ugly! – Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!\N– Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard! Sakura, this is impossible for you. For your own sake,\Njust hurry up and go home! I could say the exact same thing to you! Hey, why are those two\Non such bad terms? D-Do you think I care about\Nsomething stupid like that? Man…all there is to do\Nis write my name, why does it take this much time! Hey! Hinata! What are you\Ndoing over there? N-Naruto… Umm…uhhhh…well… Just like I thought,\Nthis kid is strange. A scratch… Uh-um… this…is-- See ya! Naruto… It’s about time for\Nthe scroll exchange. Well, I wonder how\Nmany teams will survive… Teams who have\Ntaken the scroll, stay with the representative\Nand move to the gate! We’ll all start simultaneously\Nin 30 minutes!! Yeah! Survival is our forte! Hinata, don’t show your weakness. Uh, okay… Life or death… It’s a pain but we just have to do this. Since it’s come to this,\NNaruto will be our target. For snacks, there’s potato chips... – What about shortcake...?\N– I can’t believe you two! Okaaaay! I won’t lose! I’ll bring down whoever comes near me. – Yes! 					– Cha! Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here… We have the chance to fulfill\Nour mission in earnest… Sure, the enemy teams are scary but, I’m really scared of spending\Nfive days with this guy. Target the rookies first. They said that from now on\Nit’s okay to kill, which makes it easier. Master Guy, I’ll do my best!\NI’ll definitely succeed! We now start the second\Ntest of the Chunin Exam! Look for the brats! Those three, right? All right! Let’s go! Okay! First, we search for that thing. Can you do it, Hinata? Yes. Byakugan! Slow down, Lee!\NWe just started. I know. But… I can’t stay still! Who knows what kind of\Npowerful foe is waiting for us. Hot-blooded fool… As you already understand,\Nwe have only one target! W-What are you doing, Choji? Just a little break…\NI’m already tired, and hungry… What are you suddenly saying?! It hasn’t been five minutes\Nsince we started! But I can’t help it. I’m hungry… You! If you were able to bring snacks, you should have been able\Nto bring one Kunai knife! Ino! Hide! Uh-oh! This kind of thing continuing\N for five days…? Anyway, the tower is the\Ngoal for everyone, right? So it would be clever for us to make\Na trap in the vicinity of the tower. Okay…wasting no time, huh? Where are they? Heh…kids. It’s like begging to be found,\Nstanding in that conspicuous place. They sensed our presence, but, evidently they haven’t\Ngrasped where we are. What happened? 					You’re pale. W-What is that?! The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village\Nsense body temperature and perspiration, then in mass, swoop down\Non their prey. If they continue to suck\Nyour blood for five minutes, you go to the other world… Using this behavior, we’d set a trap on the path\Nenemies would use to escape. D-Darn it… That’s one team gone! It sounds like they’ve already started. Wasn't that someone screaming\Njust now? I-I’m kinda getting nervous. I-It was nothing. Sakura.\NBelieve it! I-I have to pee… Y-You…fool! What are you doing\Nin front of a lady! Go to the grass! Aaah, that was a lot!\NI’m refreshed. Like I said, not in front of a lady--! S-Sasuke… no matter what,\Nyou don’t have to go that far. W-What was that for…? What are you doing…all of a sudden?! What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it? Sasuke! It can’t be helped! Sasuke, please stop! Look closely at him! Talk! Where’s the real Naruto! I have no idea what\Nyou’re talking about! What happened to the scratch\Non you face? I’m asking what happened to the scratch\Nyou got before from the Proctor! And your Shuriken holster\Nis on your left leg. That guy’s right handed! You’re worse at transformation\Nthan Naruto, you phony! Unlucky! You got me.\Nln that case… Which one of you got the scroll? If you listen to me obediently,\NI’ll spare your lives. I see! Then I’ll resort to force! Hey, can you hear it?

Shikamaru…\NThat pill that Choji took earlier.. It seemed like some sort\Nof trump card, but does he have a chance to win? He said that he has a secret weapon. He brought the Akimichi clan’s\Nultimate secret pills on this mission… These are the Triad Colored Pills\Nof green, yellow, and red. If you take it,\Nyou can gain explosive powers. The energy that each pill\Ncontains is enormous! I see! I see!\NSo that’s why he was so confident! But…there’s always a side effect\Nto any pills that work too well. Damn… I didn’t think it would hurt\Nso much with just the Spinach Pill. I hope that Choji can settle it\Nwith just the green pill. Don’t take the red one,\Nno matter what, Choji.

He’s worried if Choji is going to be able\Nto handle that monster with just the pills. True… If we were to assess\Nthe situation objectively, that giant’s ability is unknown… The possibility of Choji being able\Nto defeat him might be close to zero. But… That is how battle is… Don’t get carried away, loser! Shatter Palm! Did you know? When there’s a group of people\Nof five or so, there’s always one loser.

This guy is useless too… That is true… No matter how hard I try on my own… I… Seems like I hit it right on the nose.

You really are a loser to the end! Your high spirit didn’t last long at all,\Nonly at the beginning…! You really are the ideal loser! A loser like you shouldn’t have come\Nto a place like this! You should blame your stupid leader\Nfor choosing you! Shikamaru… Neji’s right. It’s how a battle is. From the start, this mission\Nwasn’t for recreation. It’s life or death. Hey Shikamaru… I already anticipated the worst scenario in which we would be fighting\Nseparately on our own. And at this point, if we’re not prepared for\N“one person, one kill,” we might not be able\Nto catch up to Sasuke. Choji is a good guy,\Nbut he doesn’t have the confidence. He thinks that\Nhe’s the weakest of all of us. He actually is weak.\NAnybody can see that. That’s why he was the first to\Nstay behind to try to be useful. Just as I thought… But… Choji and I have worked as a team\Nfor many years, so coordinating with him\Nis easiest for me. But Shikamaru… But, if we fight against each other,\Nyou might be stronger. I might have given up fighting\Nagainst you too. And you’re you… But… Shikamaru…has always… Shikamaru has always\Nbelieved in me… Choji…are you ready?! He believed that I was really strong! That’s why he left it up to me alone! Just as I thought… So everybody thinks that…\NBut…I know… More than myself or Neji\Nor any of us here… He is stronger! And…I believe it. Oh?

Orochimaru’s hideout is deep\Nin those mountains… I bet Sasuke is\Nsomewhere in those mountains… Okay, at last! Let’s hurry! Well, hold on… Why?! If we don’t hurry, night will fall before\Nwe arrive at Orochimaru’s hideout… That’s right! Sasuke is just a stone’s throw away!\NPervy Sage! If we’re going to save him,\Nwe should do it as soon as possible! Why do we have to wait?! Huh…? What? Gee… Well…I’m hungry, you see… You know… All Shinobi must … I can’t fight if I’m hungry! Up ahead will become full-blown\Nenemy territory. We won’t have time to\Nhave relaxed meals, so… Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat! Mm, this is good… You prepared this especially for us? No. It seems the prettiest girl\Nin the bar fell to my charm, you see. She made these with tender loving care. I’ll go make some tea. Oh…thanks… Tastes pretty good. Tea is ready. Here you go! Here you go. Thanks… Here you go. Thank you, Sasame… Sasame, you should come here\Nand eat with us, too. Okay… Pervy Sage…What’s wrong…?! Naruto…! Sasame did it… Since it’s come to this, they’re ours. Your wound still hasn’t healed. Kagero, you wait here. No mistake…They’re Leaf Ninja. If we take care of the Leaf pursuers… Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge\Nthe power of the Fuma Clan. Yeah… Let’s come back with good news. And with the heads of\Nthe Leaf Ninja as souvenirs! I finally found it! At first, I thought it was someone\Nfrom the Hidden Leaf Village. But it’s Sasame, believe it or not… Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero… This is an odd reunion. Where’s Arashi?!\NHe wasn’t with all you guys?! Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru\Nand is spending his days training. Can I see Arashi?! If you’re also going to work together\Nwith us for Lord Orochimaru, I’m sure you’ll be able to see him. How’d it go? You’ve done well. With this, I’ll be able to see Arashi, right? After we’ve finished them off! Why?! Weren’t we just supposed to\Ntake them to Lord Orochimaru for examination after capturing them?! We only need the heads\Nfor the examination. No! These people… For my sake…! Move it! – Wha--?! 					– Huh?! What?! The Fuma numbing medicine\Ndidn’t work! We knew about it all along\Nfrom the beginning! Sakura! Substitution…?! I leave Sasame to you! Leave her to me! Sasame… Hang in there! Why…? Why does Sasame have\Nto do something like this?! No, it’s not that she’s doing it\Nagainst her will…! It’s something she wanted to do! Liar! It’s true… What… What should I do to be able\Nto see Arashi again? It’s not a difficult thing. You just have to put the lights out of those\Nwho infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies. We have to kill them…?! We’ll take them back to Lord Orochimaru\Nfor examination. So we’re not going to kill, right? If we carry out that work,\NLord Orochimaru will acknowledge us. Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone\Nare being tricked by Orochimaru. He says that you’ll just be used\Nand thrown away… Hanzaki’s just a traitor\Nwho abandoned the village. Will you believe what we say? Or will you believe what a traitor says? Lord Orochimaru will surely restore\Nour Fuma Clan… Sasame, although you’re still young,\Nyou’re also one of the Fuma. Assist in the restoration\Nof our Fuma Clan… So you guys did trick Sasame! It’s all for the restoration\Nof the Fuma Clan! You little! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here I go! Wha--! U-zu-ma-ki…! Naruto Barrage! This is bad…! Rasengan! This is for Sasame.\NPrepare yourselves! Naruto! You’re…from before?! The Earth Style Jutsu user\Nin question, huh? However, there’s no point to using that\NArt in this rocky area. Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from\Ninside the ground and the spreading of its wings under\Nthe sunlight is but a momentary gleam. That’s when I die as Kagero! Be careful! What’s this…? Look! Naruto… Wha--?! U-Unbelievable! You were a woman…?! The clan will once again be\Nin a place lit by the sunlight… Lord Orochimaru promised that… I’ll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art\Nif it’s for the sake of that. Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera! Naruto! Come with me! Naruto! I-I feel like…I’ve seen this before… It’s Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu. I summoned the extraordinarily\Nsturdy stomach of the Mount Myoboku’s\Nlwajuku Giant Toad. Stomach…? Yikes! It’s melting… If I didn’t do this, we wouldn’t have been able to\Ndefend ourselves from her Chakra. I believed…that the clan\Nwould someday… I believed in that. Sh-She vanished. I’ve got to hand it to her. She probably put all of her life\Non the line and attempted to save her comrades… It’s unforgivable! Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja… Their feelings toward the clan\Nis the same as our feelings! Manipulating the Fuma’s desire\Nto restore their clan… I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what! Wh-Where are we? Kagero…! You risked your life to save us? You idiot… Please… Please use your Medical Ninjutsu\Nto save her. Our comrade doesn’t have\Nlong to live! Put your hands to your chests and think. Think about what you weren’t\Nable to accomplish…okay? We risked our lives working for you…\Nto help you, Lord Orochimaru. In order to restore the Fuma Clan! Please recognize our work! You’ll just have to atone for\Nyour failure with your bodies. Lord Orochimaru! I’m sorry for the betrayal! When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… That’s Orochimaru’s residence! It really is just like him to construct\Nhis residence underground. Sasuke is somewhere inside\Nthat residence, right? Sakura, let’s hurry! Right! Be careful!\NFirst Avenue of hell is up ahead! Will a devil appear,\Nor will a snake appear? Heh! I’m looking forward to it! I’ll kick the butts of the devil\Nand the snake. And I’ll save Sasuke and Arashi!

It was worth teaching you Genjutsu\Nin survival training during the Genin Exam. You truly have a talent for it. Huh? Release the Genjutsu and\Nwake up Naruto and Shikamaru! Naruto will be delighted. He’ll be getting a mission\Nafter such a long while. What do you mean by a mission? Be careful… It’s the first A-Ranked mission\Nsince the Land of the Waves. Village in Distress:\NA New A-Ranked Mission! Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked\Nmission in the condition we are in?! What do we have to do?! Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company\Nof the Sand Village. Sakura… Release the Genjutsu\Non Naruto and Shikamaru, and go after Sasuke. I feel uneasy…\Nabout that unusual Chakra. But then, we should wake up Ino and Choji\Nand go in a large group. There may already\Nbe quite a large number of Sand and Sound Shinobi\Nwho have infiltrated this village. Actions lose quickness when there’s more\Nthan the fundamental four in a squad… and it becomes difficult to\Nhide from the enemy. You learned that in the Academy's\Npatrol practical training, right? Oh, I see! Then four means\Nthat you’ll come with us… No, I must not leave here. Summoning Jutsu! As for the rest, this Pakkun will\Ntrack down Sasuke by scent! C-Could it be…\Nthe one other member is this puppy?! Hey! Little girl!\NDon’t you be calling me a cute puppy! I didn’t say…cute. Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsu\Non Naruto and Shikamaru! Okay! Release! What is it…Sakura? Get down! I’ll tell you later!\NJust stay down! Shikamaru…you were…\Nfrom the beginning… Owwee! You were able to release Genjutsu, too! Why were you pretending\Nto be asleep?! Humph! I don’t want to\Nend up getting involved! Heck no…\NI could care less about Sasuke! Owwee! W-What's going on…? Naruto! Behind you! F-Fast… Not just fast… Guy Sensei! Now, I’ll announce the mission! As soon as you’ve heard what\Nthe mission is, go through that hole. Track down Sasuke,\Njoin up and then stop him! Then await next orders\Nin a safe place. Huh? Did something happen\Nto Sasuke?! I’ll tell you the reason en route! Let’s go! Jeez… Why me? Hey, boy! Huh…? If this mission is a success, as a reward I’ll let you\Ntouch my paw-pads. So don’t sulk like that! Huh? See? They’re soft and supple! Su..pple…? Yes, very… Soft and Supple! Let’s just go! H-Hey! Will it be okay with just them? They’ll be okay.\NPakkun is with them. As long as they don’t pursue too far… To think I’d be able to fight you again… This barrier can’t be broken\Nunless it’s from the inside. If Lord Hokage would just\Ntake out one of those four, we could help… Hey, it’s gonna start soon. Put up a barrier on the inside, too! Sure! Hm… It doesn’t look like\NI’ll be able to get out this easily. You don’t really mean that. It’d be tougher for you if someone\Ncame in and got in the way, right? Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken! That’s too easy! Striking Shadow Snake! With such a weak technique… It sucks to get old, eh,\NSarutobi Sensei? Substitution?! Earth Style: Great Mud River! Is this it? I don’t think so! Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb! Fire Dragon Bomb! He’s combined Earth and Fire! Excellent, Lord Hokage! Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru. Very good… Really, I’ve been grossly underestimated. Did you think you could kill me\Nwith that level of Jutsu? Humph… A hateful fellow as usual! Don’t say that. A high maintenance student is cute.\NRight, Sarutobi Sensei? Something’s strange… All of the Academy’s classes\Ndoing self-study. And that smoke… That's coming from the direction\Nof the exam arena. Isn't there some disturbance\Nto the east? I wonder if something happened… This is definitely strange! But sudden self-study is\Nsure a smack in the eye! It’s been like this for a while! Yeah. Iruka Sensei\Nand everyone are late… Aren’t they, Konohamaru? Konohamaru? Yikes! Jeez, what is this?! And Mom just bought this for me! I’ll loan you my colored pencil. What’re you saying?!\NThis color is this spring’s new color! Aww, what'll I do? That is…? I wonder if Naruto and the others\Nwent to stop Sasuke? Those brats? But surely, some Genin won’t\Nbe able to make any difference… Hm? Is this the data of\Nthat kid back there? You give him too much credit. Think again! You’ll trip up if you underestimate him. Teachers' Office There is information that several units\Nhave already infiltrated the village…! We should evacuate the students\Nto a safe place right away! Yes… And without causing panic\Namong the students! Then let’s evacuate the students as soon as possible under\Nthe pretense of an evacuation drill! Isn’t it about time\Nwe stopped playing around? This isn’t an Academy class, so… You have a point. Did you foresee your final moments? I won’t go easy on you\Njust because you’re doddering. I look forward to it. Depending on your Jutsu, I might have to have you\Nstart over at the Academy! Please don’t disappoint me too much! W-Wow… What Chakra?! Yeah… It seems the air is\Nbearing down within the body! Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu! Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation! That technique! One! He is using a Summoning Jutsu\Nas a shield. And this dead person is… Two! I must stop the third one at any cost…! Three! It looks like the third one was no good.\NOh well… It looks like I stopped the third one. Now, this is where it gets tough… He summoned those two of all people… I-It can’t be!\NThose personages are…! Those personages are? Now, what will you do,\NSarutobi Sensei…? No… Lord…Third Hokage. Okay! Everyone, please move quickly! Oh, what a day! My favorite colored pencil\Ndidn’t have to break like that! Lousy evacuation drill…\NSelf-study was better. Konohamaru’s been quiet, hasn’t he?\NI wonder what’s wrong? Huh? Yeah. After the whole school does\Na long self-study, the whole school does\Nan evacuation drill. This is too strange! Okay! Stop! Get in line! That look on Iruka Sensei’s face… Something’s definitely going on here! And also… Okay, everyone!\NDon’t go off on your own. That rainbow… It's been\Nbugging me for a while! What’s that, Old Man?\NThere’s a strange rainbow! It’s an unusual rainbow! Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru? Yeah! And I’ve never seen\Nsuch a pretty rainbow! I see, I see.\NBut, Konohamaru… Hmm? Rainbows used to symbolize snakes… And it’s said that they bode evil. Such a pretty thing? That’s a lie! I see, I see. Symbolizes snakes…\Nls something happening? Long time no see…Saru. Oh, it’s you…\NYou’ve gotten old, Sarutobi. I never thought I would meet\Nthe great brothers in this manner… It’s regretful. This is bad. That Summoning Jutsu… Who in the world are they?! Please prepare yourselves… Lord First Hokage… Lord Second Hokage! That’s right… The one with the black hair\Nis the First Hokage. The one with the white hair\Nis the Second Hokage. They are both reputed to\Nbe the highest Shinobi and they are the Hokages\Nwho built the today’s Leaf Village! Reanimation, huh? This youth summoned us with\Nthe Forbidden Jutsu, then? He’s something else… Then, Sarutobi! Does this mean we must…fight you? Let’s stop the old people\Nget-together talk… Shall we get started? There’s always fighting…\Nno matter when you live. You like that, don’t you? No good will come by deriding the dead\Nand playing around with time! I get it! So that’s what happened! That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

All I was thinking about at that time\Nwas protecting someone I cared about… What I’m capable of\Ndoing right now… I was thinking… What? There are many variables such\Nas mission level, or platoon’s member structure… But no matter how small\Na platoon might be, I think it’s important to assign\None Medical Ninja to it… I know that already… I wrote exactly the same thing\Nin a report long ago regarding the survival rate and mission\Nachievement rate of small platoons.

I’ll go buy something for you. The Battle Begins:\NNaruto vs. Sasuke To be honest,\NI really don’t understand. It seems there were opinions that, with the final exam being suspended, no one should pass\Nthis time around. But I hear the late Third Hokage\Nhighly praised your match. It seems he intended to recommend you\Nfor Chunin. The lords of other lands\Nwho observed the fight and the proctors were of\Nthe same opinion as well… In that case, it’s not in my place\Nto say this or that about it. From now on, strive to perform in a manner\Nthat is worthy of that headband… Congratulations!\NAs of today, you’re a Chunin! – Wow… 					– Wow! Even you who’s never motivated\Nlook respectable. It doesn’t suit you. Don’t laugh, I say… For the time being, let’s have a toast to celebrate\NShikamaru’s promotion to Chunin! Let’s eat! Oh! Choji! Don’t eat the meat before the toast! But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so… There’s a lot of meat. Eat up! All right! Right now,\NI have no interest in you… Your target is Naruto, after all. You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji. Don’t you know how to savor the taste? Never mind! Even if I eat a lot,\NI know how to savor properly. Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meat\Nthat I’ve been grilling! The last bite! This is the conclusion and will become the meat with\Nthe greatest value that should be savored! I won’t hand over\Nthis last bite to anyone! What’re you acting cool for,\Nyou idiot?! Everyone makes fun of you\Nbecause you’re like this! – You’re just a fa--\N– Ino! That’s a taboo word! But really, Choji… A meal isn’t a battle. Relax at a time like this at least.\NWhat a pain. Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed…\NToo lazy… I wonder if these guys\Nwill be okay from here. In particular… Choji. With you it’s nothing but food. Do a little training sometime! Choji… You’re lucky that your mind\Ndoesn’t restrict what you eat… I’ve got it rough with a diet. Why do you have to diet, Ino? Girls want to be seen as cute as possible\Nby the one they like! But that person might not always\Nlike a thin person. In the first place,\Nmost boys don’t like fa-- Not that… They like thin girls. And, vice-versa. You should be a little more conscious\Nof your body, Choji. You won’t be popular. Heh… She doesn’t get it. Men don’t like thin women\Nas much as women think. More likely men who like chubby women\Nare the most common. And, vice-versa…I’d say. I bet she’d be twice as popular if she were to gain a little more weight\Ninstead of dieting. You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru. And you’re smart, too. Hmm? I know it in my heart… You’re much more awesome\Nthan the likes of Sasuke or Neji. Well, I’ve never even thought about that.\NI’m me, so… But you’re the only one\Nwho became a Chunin in the Chunin Exam this time… But you might be better\Nat fighting, right? I might’ve given up if\NI’d gotten into one with you. But earlier,\NSensei told me that all I do is eat and that I’m not progressing… I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you. It’s stupid talking about how which is. Well, don’t worry too much\Nabout what Asuma says… You should live naturally\Nand take things easy. See you later! I’m going home.

Naruto! The time is right… Head for the Leaf Village, now! I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh? Yes! I’m carrying out fitness training\Nto get ready for the surgery. I want to return as soon as\NI can after the surgery, so… Oww! Ow-ow… Lee… Yes?! What is it? You won’t die\Nif you give up being a Shinobi. Why are you so fixated\Non being a Shinobi? My everything is proving that\Neven I can become a fine Ninja… You might die. Even if you succeed… Even so… I promise you! That’s my dream, so… Why…do you snap this much\Nat the mention of Hokage’s name? Unlike you… I will be the heir to the name\Nof Hokage, no matter what! Because, Hokage is my dream! In this village, promising children\Nare being brought up. Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough,\Nyou were a wonderful Hokage. The surgery is in the afternoon.\NGet ready! Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?! Yes! I got some apples…\NYou like them, right? Here, doesn’t it look good? Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife… It’s right in front of you, believe it. It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrained\Njust because you’re in front of Sasuke. I’d rather hear lame\Nfrom anyone but you… Naruto… U-zu-ma-ki! Naruto 2K Barrage! Knock it off already! Summoning Jutsu! I will…protect Sakura! I-I give up, believe it… Sasuke… Thank you. You rescued me from\Nthe Sand Ninja, right? No... The person who rescued you…\Nwas Naruto. You are weak. Why are you weak…? It’s because you don’t have enough… ...hate. Good. I peeled it nicely. I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and… Here, Sasuke. Ow! What happened? S-Sasuke? Huh? What’s going on? Wh-What? Y-You don’t have to glare\Nat me like that. Hey, Naruto… Wh-What is it? Fight me… Right now! What?! Here you are,\Njust treated by Old Lady Tsunade. What’re you saying? Just fight! Sasuke… You think you saved me? I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokage\Nor whatever, but… she should’ve just minded\Nher own business! What?! You said you wanted to fight me, right? I’m saying let’s do it now! Or have you chickened out? S-Sasuke. Hey…\NWhat’s going on?! Naruto, you say something too! What’s this all of a sudden? This is perfect, believe it! I was just thinking\NI wanted to fight you! S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay? Come with me! What’s…this feeling?\NMy lower belly feels tight… I want to fight you, too. And… I feel a thrill. What’s so funny? Nothing’s funny, believe it!\NI’m happy! When I think\NI can finally beat you here! Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priority\Nof our organization, Akatsuki. What did you say?\NDon’t talk foolish, you failure! I’m not going to be\Na failure forever! Right now,\NI have no interest in you… You… A loser like you better\Nnot act all high and mighty! Hah! It’s unlike you to lose\Nyour cool and raise a fuss. So uncharacteristic. It couldn’t be that you picked a fight\Nand then got scared, could it, Sasuke? Just bring it, now! Put on your headband before that!\NI’ll wait. I don’t need such a thing… Just do it! You wouldn’t even be able…\Nto put one knick on my forehead! You’re wrong! I’m saying this is a testament to fighting\Non equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi! And I’m saying stuff like that\Nis acting high and mighty! Do you think that we’re equal?! Yeah, I do! I’ve never once\Nthought that I’m inferior to you! You’re an eyesore! That’s because you remain weak!\NLittle Sasuke! Naruto! Sasuke! Don’t be getting carried away!

What?! Why didn’t you wake me\Nup earlier! I can’t be just snoozing through\Nin a place like this! And what about Pervy Sage? Where’s Pervy Sage?! I’ve got to have him watch\Nover my training. Huh? What are you talking about,\Nall of a sudden? I don’t know what’s got into you. Huh? My clothes are missing!

You know what?\Nlt isn’t gonna make a difference if you rush around\None day beforehand. Resting is training, too, you know… Huh? Hey…Naruto. What in the world\Nis going on? I’m…so…hungry…. Don’t keep scaring me like that… Oh yeah. It’s such a drag but… I bought this fruit basket as\Na get-well present for Choji. But the doctor said he couldn’t have it. So let’s eat it together. Choji? Is he that sick? No, no, don’t be fooled. He got sick from eating\Ntoo much BBQ. That’s just like him! Yeah well, and neither of you are the type\Nto have female visitors. So here… Looks good. W-What is it? Since Choji can’t have any,\Nlet’s eat in front of him. What a drag this guy is! Huh? No one’s here. Out to lunch? Oh well… Okay! Hmm? Lee, I’m putting the\Nflowers here, okay? I’m still hungry! Are you harassing me, Shikamaru? Oh yeah. Why…save him? He’s an important subordinate\Nwhom I care for. My body…isn’t moving. You jerk! What the hell do you think\Nyou’re doing?! Hey Naruto… During Shadow Possession Jutsu,\Nit’s moving me too! Okay?! Sorry! Shikamaru. What the hell were you\Ntrying to do? Choji, are you better? Oh, Ino! All right! The age of\Nthe chubby has arrived! What were you trying to do\Nto Bushy Brow here?! I was trying to kill him. What?! How can he be so calm? Especially when he is not able to\Nmove with my Shadow Possession Jutsu… Why’d you have to do something\Nlike that? You beat him in the match, right? Do you have a personal grudge\Nagainst him or something? I don't have anything like that. I just wanted to kill him, that’s it. How can you say something\Nso selfish, you bastard?! You…you had a lousy upbringing,\Ndidn’t you? All you care about is yourself. Or there’s something weird about him.\Nlt gives me the chills! If he tries anything, it’ll be too much\Nof a burden for me and Naruto… What the heck should we do? If you get in my way,\NI’ll kill you both too. What?! Go ahead, if you can! Hey Naruto, hold on! Should I try to scare him with a bluff? I know you’re strong from seeing you\Nin the competition with him… But…we can keep up with you. We didn’t show you our best skills\Nin the preliminaries. And it’s two against one! You’re the one who’s at a disadvantage. If you’re smart, you’ll do what\NI tell you and just get lost. I’ll say it again…\Nif you get in my way… I’ll kill you. Where the heck do you get off…?! There’s no way in hell\NI’ll let you do that! I’ve been telling you\Nto back off, haven’t I? This guy has the strength of a monster.\NYou get it, don’t you? I have a real monster in me!\NI’m not going to lose to this guy! Huh? I heard Naruto was here too,\Nso I came to see, but… What a mess… Well, I guess this means he’s okay. Huh? What’s worth making him mad,\Nyou idiot! A monster, huh…? Me too, actually. It’s just like you said.\NI had a terrible upbringing. When I came into this world, I took the life of the woman\Nsome might call my mother. So that I could become\Nthe strongest Shinobi… my father brought his\NNinjutsu upon me, and so I became possessed\Nby a Sand Spirit. I was born a monster. A Sand Spirit? It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of\Nan old monk from Village Hidden in the Sand\Nwho was sealed inside the tea caldron. It must be a type of\Ncacodemon possession Jutsu, performed to a baby before it is born. To go that far…\Nthey must have been totally nuts. Is it possible…that there could be\Nsomething inside him too? What a thing for a parent to be doing!\NSuch a twisted kind of love. Love? Don’t measure me by your standards. Family, huh… Let me tell you what kind of ties\NI have to my family. They’re ties of hatred,\Nties of murderous intent… My family’s just lumps of flesh. Nourished with the life of my mother, I was crafted as the\Nultimate masterpiece of the village… The Kazekage’s child. I was taught by my father\Nthe innermost secrets of the Shinobi… spoiled, over-protected,\Nand left on my own. And I thought that was love… Until that incident happened. That incident…?! What are you talking about? Just what happened?! In the six years since the time\Nwhen I was 6 years old… My real father has tried to assassinate me\Nmore times than I can count! But I thought you just said that\Nyour father spoiled you… What’s going on here? Those who are too strong are\Napt to become feared. Born through the Jutsu,\Nmy mind was unstable… I guess the idiots in my village finally realized that\NI had emotional problems… For my father, Kazekage, at the same time I was\Nthe ultimate weapon for the village, I was also a dangerous,\Nfearsome presence. It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure\Nas soon as I turned six. And I was treated politely simply because\NI was feared. To them, now I’m just a relic of the past\Nthat they want to see disappear. So what did I have in this life,\Nwhy did I keep living? When I asked myself that,\NI couldn’t find the answer. But, as long as you’re alive,\Nyou need a reason… If you don’t have one,\Nit’s just the same as being dead. What’s this guy saying? I…can understand that… He…is the same as me. So this is the answer I came to… I am living in order to kill\Nhuman beings other than myself. After living in the fear of never knowing\Nwhen I might be murdered, finally I became calm. By killing assassins, I finally\Ncomprehended the reason why I live… I live fighting for only myself\Nand loving myself… And if I see that all other people\Nin this world exist only to make me realize that, there could be no world\Nmore wonderful. And as long as there are\Nothers to kill who can make me feel\Nthis happiness to be alive, I will never disappear. W-What’s this freak talking about…? He’s real gone! I was also alone… And suffered ‘cause\NI didn’t know why I was alive… But Iruka Sensei recognized me\Nfor who I was… and that was the first time\NI realized why I lived… But this guy…\Nthis guy grew up alone. And he ony feels alive\Nwhen he kills other people. H-How can there be someone like this? The worlds we live in\Nare too different…! There’s no way…\Nthat I can beat a guy like this! W-What’s wrong, Naruto? What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should\Nhave stopped him from moving, but… Naruto! Naruto! Hey, get yourself together! What a drag this guy is! Naruto! Now, let me feel it…! Oh no! Stop right there! Tomorrow’s the final round! There’s no need to rush like this! Or do you just want to\Nstay here starting today? Don’t leave me alone! I’m not bleeding, but\Nit hurts a lot right here. What…am I?! I will…kill you all without a fail. Just wait. One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two!

19,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart The Demon in the Snow Gatô, why did you come here? And who are those henchmen? Our strategy has changed\Na little… I'm sorry about this Zabuza, but you will die here. What?! Since hiring a regular Shinobi\Ncosts a lot of money, I hired Rouge Ninjas like you. And, it would have been even\Nmore ideal to save my money and effort if\NNinja-to-Ninja battles ended in each killing the other off. Well, you are certainly not worthy\Nof being called the Demon of the\NHidden Mist Village. If you were to ask me,\Nyou're just a cute little demon! What are those guys? So many of them… Kakashi…I apologize. Our fight ends here... As long as my reason to\Ntake down Tazuna is gone, there is no reason to fight you either. Yeah... you are right. That reminds me... I owe him something. He squeezed my arm 'til it broke... Huh, he's dead. You bastard! What do you think you're doing, hey?! Stop! Don't act so recklessly…! You say something, too!\NHe was your comrade, right? Shut up, punk.\NHaku is already dead. What…? Don't you feel anything watching\Nhim doing that! Weren't you with Haku for a long time! As Gatô used me…\NI was simply using Haku. I thought I'd told you… We Shinobi are merely tools. What I wanted were his skills\Nand not Haku himself. I have no regrets... Do you...\NDo you really mean that? Naruto, stop. There's no need to fight\Nhim anymore...  Besides... Shut up!\NMy enemy is still... this one! He... He really liked you! Is there someone special in your life? He liked you that much! When a person feels he wants\Nto protect a person special to him, that person can truly become strong. Even so,\Ndon't you feel anything at all?! It's difficult for me to completely\Nbecome a Shinobi. You really... honestly... don't feel anything at all? I'd like to make that person's\Ndream come true... For that, I could completely\Nbecome a Shinobi. When a person becomes\Nas strong as you... Does that person really\Nbehave like you? He threw his life away\Nfor you! I'd like to make that\Nperson’s dream come true... That is my dream. He didn't even fulfill his\Nown dreams and yet... I was happy. To die as a tool...! That's...\NThat's... too painful... Kid... Don't say anything... anymore. Haku was... He wasn't just thinking of me. He was feeling pain inside\Nfor you while he battled you guys too... I know. 					He was too kind... I'm glad we could fight with you\Nat the end. Huh? Yes, little punk,\Nit's as you say, after all... Shinobi are human too... Maybe it's impossible to become\Nan emotionless tool... I've lost. Kid! Give me the Kunai knife! Okay... What?! Enough! Take them down! Right! Are you crazy? Do you think you can win by yourself\Nagainst this many of us? D-Demon! If you're so anxious\Nto join your friend... you go ahead... alone! Unfortunately... I don't... intend on going...\Nto the same place... as Haku! W-What?! Pretending to be so tough... You're going to hell with me! It's no big deal... When the Demon of\Nthe Hidden Mists Village dies and goes to hell,\Nhe can become a real demon. Look forward to it! I'll let you find out\Nfor sure if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell! Haku... Now... it's goodbye, Haku... Thanks for everything... I'm sorry... Don't look away. It's the end for\Na man who lived fiercely. Yup... Did I... die...? Sasuke! Sakura... Am I... am I...?! Sakura, you're heavy. Huh?! Sasuke... Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...! Sakura... 					That hurts... Things turned out well,\N didn't they, Sakura? Stop, you shouldn't move...! Anyway, where's Naruto? And also,\Nwhat happened to that mask guy? Naruto's fine. And... the masked kid,\Nhe died... Died? Did Naruto get him? Well... I'm not really sure,\Nbut he protected Zabuza... I had faith in you. You are awesome, Sasuke! You avoided getting inflicted with\Nany mortal wounds! From the beginning... he intended to... Naruto! Sakura... Sasuke's all right!\NHe's alive! Huh? He was feeling pain inside\Nfor you while he battled you guys too... He was too kind... I see... He... So, Sasuke's all right too... That's a relief... Hey, hey, hey! You guys are too relaxed! Darn Ninja...!\NKilling our source of money! Now that it's come to this, there's no choice but to attack\Nthe whole town and take everything valuable! Shoot, this isn't good! Kakashi Sensei! Don't you have a Jutsu\Nto annihilate them all at once? That's impossible!\NI've used too much Chakra! Here we go! Enemies who come any closer\Nto the island... With all the might of\Nall the island's people... will not be allowed to live! Yeah! Inari! Heroes always arrive\Non the scene late! Inari... You guys... Okay, I'm gonna help out, too! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I can do that even\Nwith my scarce Chakra... At least, it will bluff... Shadow Clone Jutsu! Kakashi Version! So... are you ready to fight?! No, we're not! We've done it! Sounds like it’s over. Yeah... Kakashi...\NI need to ask you a favor. What is it? His...\NI want to see his face... All right. Huh? Snow... Snow at this time\Nof the year...? Haku... 					Are you crying? Thanks, Kakashi... You were always at my side... At the very least... I can be at your side in the end. If it's possible... I'd like to go... to the same place... as you. This guy... He was born in a village\Nwhere it snowed a lot. I see... He was a boy as pure as snow... You'd be able to go, Zabuza. The two of you... together. But you know, Kakashi Sensei... Hmm? I wonder if the way a Ninja\Nshould be is really as these\Ntwo were saying. Shinobi should not seek\Nthe reason for their own existence. What's important is to\Nexist merely as tools. That's the same in the Land of Leaves. I wonder if that's what\Nit really means to become a real Ninja. I guess... I guess...! I don't like that! Do you think so, too? Hmm... Well... That's why all Ninja live trying to figure that\Nout without realizing... Like Zabuza... and that kid... Okay! Huh? I've just decided! I'm going to pursue my\Nown Way of Ninja! I'm gonna sprint straight\Nahead and pursue a way that I absolutely\Nwon't regret! Thanks to you the bridge\Nwas safely completed, but we will miss you very much. Take care. Thank you for everything. Now, now! We'll come back for\Na visit again, Tazuna! For sure...? Huh? Inari... you're gonna\Nmiss us, aren't you? It's all right to cry.\NGo ahead and cry! I won't cry! It's all right if you cry,\NNaruto! Oh, is that so? See ya! Oh....! You are so stubborn. That boy changed Inari's mind... and Inari changed the minds\Nof the village people. That boy created a bridge\Nlinking us to hope, a bridge called courage. So a linking bridge... Speaking of bridges, we need to name\Nthis bridge, don't we? That's true. In that case, I have a perfect name\Nfor this bridge. Yeah, what is it? The Naruto Great Bridge?\NHow's that ? That's a good name. Okay! I'll get back soon\Nand have Iruka Sensei treat me to ramen as\Nthe mission completion celebration! And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru\Ntales of my heroic exploits! Then I... Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go\Non a date when we get back to the village? No, I don't think so. Just like that...?! You know! You know!\NI'll go with you! Be quiet! Shut up! Naruto! What? Are you sure\Nthat name's okay? This name is to wish that\Nthis bridge will never collapse... And someday, it'll be the name\Nof a very famous bridge... A name heard around the world. That's truly what I hope. Hey, hey! Our Group Seven always\Nhas the easy missions lately. Meanwhile, there are plenty of\Npowerful Ninja like Zabuza and Haku in other lands. Aren't there more exciting missions\Nwhere I can be more active? Where I can use my Way of\Nthe Ninja and my soul like…you know? Next time:\N""A New Chapter Begins:\N		The Chunin Exam!""

220,"So this is the Shukaku? It’s the first time I’ve seen\Nthe real thing… It’s dangerous here!\NWe have to get away! But! Gaara Sensei… Shut up. Gaara is trying…to protect you! So hurry! R-Right. Hey! Could that be…?! Yeah… The Shukaku transformation\Nis starting. Gaara… Naruto! Naruto! Hinata, Sakura. Matsuri, you okay? Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei… I leave her to you… Hold it! You are badly hurt! But… You’ll just become unable\Nto move right away! I’ll give you some first-aid treatment! Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands The distance created between us\Nbecame too big, because we were always together Your honest reply, “See you…” coming from that brash mouth\Nmakes it sadder.

I knew it. Sakura! Hurry!\Nlt looks like we don’t have much time! Got it! First, put your hands out. R-Right… What’s the meaning of this? What is it, Neji? That guy wearing the armor is\Nreleasing Chakra stronger than Gaara… who’s half transformed into a beast. That person called himself Seimei,\Nthe creator of the Village of Artisans. He said something about being reborn\Nas the ultimate Ninja tool. That jerk!\NHe’s taken away Gaara’s Chakra! Come to think of it, the enemy\Nwe fought wore similar armor… and took away a great deal\Nof my Chakra. Armor that sucks up Chakra… And that alarming form… It doesn’t look like\Nwe can just carelessly get close. Now… What do we do? I didn’t figure on fighting\Nagainst the Shukaku… However, this is fun, too. As great as the Shukaku may be,\Nthis way, I can prove that it’s no match for the ultimate Ninja tool\Nof the Village of Artisans. Why is this guy so strong? I won’t allow my important people… to get hurt! If not, I will stop you, even if that means that\NI have to kill you! Why…? How is it that you can fight\Nso much for other people…? They saved me from\Nthe hell of being all alone. They accepted me for\Nwho I was… that’s why…\Nthey are important to me! Love is a heart that desires to serve\Na precious person who is close to oneself, and to love and watch over that person… Love… That is why he is so strong? Gaara! What’s that?\NGaara Sensei is returning to normal? What happened to him?! Gaara might be suppressing\NShukaku of his own volition. Why? Wouldn’t he end up weakening\Nhis own battle strength? Even so, he chose to fight\Nwith his own strength and will, not Shukaku's power,\Nwhich he can’t control. So you couldn’t maintain\Nthe Shukaku body with that Chakra? I’ll…help the friends important\Nto me with my own power… How absurd. A Shinobi doesn’t need emotion. It is those who suppress their emotions\Nwho can obtain great power. Great power.\NThat power is the only justice. You’re finished now. Eat this! That’s as far as you go,\Nmonster of the Sand Village. Acting tough, huh…? You shouldn’t have\Nany Chakra left to fight with. Indeed,  I only have a little bit\Nof Chakra left… But do you think I just sat around\Nin the cage doing nothing at all? What?! Sand Tsunami! You shouldn’t have\Nany sand you can control! I’m Gaara of the desert! It’s simple for me to crush rocks\Nand turn them into sand. Kujaku: Hurricane Formation! So you still had\Nthat much power left, huh? Then I’ll just suck up all of that power! Gaara’s Chakra is being sucked out! – Wha--?! 					– Gaara Sensei! – Damn it! 					– Wait! Naruto! What, Shikamaru? Don’t stop me! You’ll just get in the way if you go! Besides, our Gaara is strong! Gaara… Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack: Shukaku's Pike! Wh-Why…? Why could you…? Someone who gave up on being human\Nand was reborn as a Ninja tool could never understand anyway. I don’t understand. Why? Why?! Giant Sand Burial! He did it! Gaara Sensei won! Yeah! Gaara! – Gaara! 					– Gaara! He’s okay… He’s just extremely fatigued on account of using\Nhis Chakra all at once. Gaara completely suppressed\Nthe Shukaku on his own volition. Yeah… I want to work hard and become an existence acknowledged\Nby other people… I thought that looking\Nat Naruto Uzumaki. Ties with other people… For me, until now, that was just hate\Nand murderous intent. However, there’s something\NI’ve understood just a little… about the ties he goes so far for\Nand talks about. Suffering, sorrow and happiness\Ncan be shared with someone. You’ve also made someone\Nyou can share with at last… Did you say something? No, nothing… We came to the trouble\Nof rushing here. To think it’d be over… It seems\Nthe inexperienced knuckleheads have grown a teeny weeny bit… You are very strict. Pervy Sage! Oh, long time no see, Naruto. Don’t give me that “long time no see”\Ngarbage, you jerk Sage! You were talking all big about\Nwatching my training, making me into your protégé\Nand stuff! Where were you traipsing\Naround until now?! Well, how can I put this?\NI was gathering information. It was probably just information\Non naked ladies anyway, right? You idiot! Even I come through when it counts… I was mainly after information\Non the Akatsuki. Akatsuki! With this I’ve been able\Nto verify their actions. And now as promised, two years later when\Nthey’ll move into high gear, I will thoroughly train you. I wonder if you’re prepared? I’ve been tired of waiting! I owe you one. No. I just repaid the debt\Nfrom last time. Next time, I’ll settle things\Nmore properly. Well, this time I’ll acknowledge\Nthat you didn’t cry. Not again. Just like a woman… What about him? Huh? Naruto? I hear he’s leaving today on\Na training journey with Jiraiya. Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin? Yeah. 					lt’s such a pain. He’s going to come back\Nhaving gotten stronger again. See you around. – Farewell… 					– See ya. Please tell Naruto… Thanks to him, I figured out what the words\NGaara Sensei spoke of meant. I’ll dedicate myself under\NGaara Sensei from now on… What did he do? Well, I guess that’s about it. I read the Village of Artisans report\Nfrom the other day. Although it didn’t go as far as\Na perfect 100, I’ll give you a passing grade. No! I’m still very much lacking\Nin experience. Of course! I’ll have you carry out\Nseveral missions and get you to build up\Nlots of experience, so make sure to dedicate yourself! What?! Does that mean\NI’m totally going to get overworked? Umm, Sakura. Got a minute? Ino? Sure. What’s up? As, as it happens,\NI was thinking about it the while… But it became totally clear to me\Non this mission! Clear that I’d be no good at all\Nat this rate! Ino. It’s frustrating,\Nbut I was envious of you. You, who everyone depended on. So, please.\NI also want to become a Medical Ninja. I know it’ll be hard. But I’ve got guts and I’ll manage\Nthe studying, no matter what. So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me? – Sure. 					– Really?! But prepare yourself. Once that happens,\Nyou’ll be my little sister protégé. What’s that…? Naturally! After all, I’ll be your\NMedical Ninja superior, you know. Man, I can’t wait. You’ll be my lovable little sister protégé. I’ll train you nice and hard. Just you watch!\NI’ll pass you up right away! Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig! I’ll do it! Billboard Brow! Why?! Why is it?! What are you talking about?! Why was I the only one left out\Nof the mission the other day?! But you were with\Na different team then, right? But everyone had taken part! She’s kind of in a rage. It’s hard being the only one left out\Nof a mission. Come to think of it, it seems Naruto finally leaves\Nfor training. I heard. It seems that Jiraiya\Nis going to be his mentor. Damn it! That guy’s going\Nto get strong again. It looks like the village will\Nget quiet for a while. Viewed in that light,\Nit’s a little bit sad, isn’t it? No! This isn’t the time\Nto be getting sad! I must work hard! Several times more,\Nseveral times more. If I don’t work hard hundreds\Nof times more than Naruto, I won’t be able to face him\Nthe next time we meet. Your guard is off! We also must grow by that time. It’s because trying to improve\Nby learning from others, that is what’s called friendship. Good grief,\Nwe’d better not lose, Akamaru. Same here! Hey, you okay, Lee?! I’m fine, I’m fine. Lady Hinata, let’s call it a day. What? I’m still… It’s about time for his departure. Oh! You won’t be able to\Nsee him for a while. I see… It looks like you’ll be\Non a long journey… Yeah! Listen up.\NBe sure to train and don’t goof off. Right! You can count on me! It’s about time to go, Naruto. Right! Okay! I’m off, Iruka Sensei! I’ll pay you back for the ramen\Nonce I’ve become a success. Jeez… Good luck, Naruto. Keep your eyes on me. What’re you doing?!\NI’ll leave you behind, Naruto. Hey. H-Hey, wait up! I also have to work hard in order\Nto catch up with Naruto. The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by It’s been two years since his departure. Now the count down to\Nthe battle begins. Those who pursue and those\Nwho are pursued. Time will not wait for the boy. As Akatsuki Organization begins\Nto take action, the day of Orochimaru’s reincarnation\Ndraws near. In order to take back what he lost, the boy once again throws himself\Ninto the maelstrom of cruel fate… Next time: “Homecoming”",,,,0.23775322766353688,,0.16445552464574575,0.061257682740688324,0.11704962825751863

Yes, precious things are never in shape You never know what it is\Nwhen you get it or lose it Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,\Nyour uniqueness into strength Even if you get lost,\Nlet's start walking One more time That darn Naruto… Zero Motivation:\NThe Guy with Cloud Envy! – C’mon!\N– Hurry up with the match! Finish it up already! Stand up and start the match! Evidently, people don’t want to\Nsee the minor players’ matches since they were really looking\Nforward to Sasuke’s match… If people aren't expecting anything\Nexciting from this battle, makes no sense\Nfor me to have it. What? You’re giving up, too? My opponent’s a girl again? Hey, why aren’t you moving?! C'mon, get started! That kid has had zero fighting spirit\Nfrom the beginning… C’mon! What is he doing?! C’mon Shikamaru!\NGet it together and do it! If you don’t come, I’ll go! Hey! Haven’t started yet… Man, that girl is so gung-ho. It doesn’t really matter if\NI become a Chunin or not. But there's no reason why\Na man should lose to a woman. Well… let’s do it! This guy’s quick to run away… Nor any reason why a man should\Nrough up a woman. But I don’t want to be\Nroughed up either. He’s the kind of Ninja that\Nuses shadows. Shadow Possession Jutsu. He’s probably trying to lure me into\Nthe trees where there're lots of shadows… but I won’t let him. Why am I the only one who always\Ngets a woman for an opponent, cripes?! Shikamaru! You get her with\Na torrent of 16 combination…! Mind if I sit here? Huh? What…you?\NYour stomach okay? What? Wasn’t Sasuke’s match next? Shh! Everything’s fine, right, Sakura?\NAfter all, it's Sasuke, right? R-Right now, I should leave her alone. It looks like Shikamaru taking part\Nin this final battle, it seems like he's in the wrong place. Don’t say that! I certainly don’t think that\Nhe has any great techniques, but that Shikamaru is\Nalways good at strategizing. That’s why I feel like we ended up\Nin the preliminary round the other day. Hmm, yeah well… And after all, he jumped down\Ninto the arena himself. He seems uncharacteristically driven. Even he can be passionate\Nonce in a while! Go! Shikamaru! Geez, I envy a cloud being so free… I guess I pretty much\Nam completely without desire… Even the reason why I became a Ninja… was because I thought\NI would have a fun life, ya know… Get it together! C’mon Shikamaru! But…of course, it’s not that easy. What’s going on with that stupid face?!\Nls he underestimating me? Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu! That’s right, with this attack,\Nmy armed attacks also were beaten down. I see… Shadow Possession Jutsu!\NI’ve seen that true identity! Evidently there’s a limit to\Nthe stretching and shortening, changing shape of the shadow… No matter how much you\Nchange the shape of the shadow, even when you stretch it, it can only span up to\Nthe size of your own shadow. That’s right isn’t it? You got it… Even if I assume that he's made up\Nthe distance, by stretching his shadow from the edge\Nof the shadow of the arena wall… This is the limit to how far\Nthe shadow can stretch. This is the scope of his attack! 15 meters, 32 centimeters! She took the distance\Nwith the folding fan. Temari is stronger at long distance\Nbattles than she is at close range… the outcome has already been decided. What? What is that sign…? That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit. Habit…? He enjoys passing time slowly.\NThat guy’s like an old man. That’s why he likes\NJapanese checkers and chess and always makes me be his opponent. When he’s stuck on a move,\Nhe always does that. Why? He’s working out his strategy. And, I’ve never beaten him. A strategy…\Nbut this is an actual fight. It’s different from a game. But it's said that formation pieces\Nthat were used to build battle strategy eventually become\Ngame pieces. Shikamaru is like a brilliant general. Wait a minute. When we grouped the Genin,\NI saw his scores. They were at about the\Nsame level of that Naruto’s. He said that moving his pencil during\Nwritten exams at the academy is a pain, and during the tests,\Nhe always sleeps instead. A pain…? He was so good at strategy games,\NI felt something wasn’t right… so I had him take an IQ test\Nunder the pretense that it was a game. And… how did it turn out?... … He was more than brilliant. With an IQ of over 200,\Nhe’s a super genius! T-Two hundred?! He’s done thinking…\Nlt starts now. Looks like you’ve got some\Nfighting spirit now… It’s pointless to hide! I wonder if he’s really got a strategy… M-Maybe… With that he has no approach! Shikamaru! Go for it! It’s pointless, isn’t it? He’ll give up soon. He hates things\Nthat are a pain in the butt. You're wrong!\NAt least, I hope so… But you may be right… How long are you going to run away!\NCut it out! It’s no use. As long as I’m on the\Noutside of this line, he absolutely can’t catch me… No, wait! Close call! You caught on well. So you were dragging your feet\Nto wait for the sun to set… in order to make the surface\Nof your own shadow larger by stretching the shadow line of the wall. As the sun goes down,\Nthe shadows lengthen. Isn't that so? That was close! Shikamaru… But why is he using shadows? After all, Shikamaru is inside\Nthe shadow of the field. If there’s even a little bit of light,\Nhe can make a shadow within a shadow! You don’t know a thing\Nabout Shikamaru! A shadow…in a shadow…? Even if I calculate the height\Nof the sun now and the limit to the distance\Nof the previous attack, there's no mistaking the distance! Temari! Up! I see. What’s this?! Darn it! I won’t let you escape! I didn’t expect that he would\Ncreate extra shadows to reach me by making a parachute with his jacket…! He’s impressive. Once I notice the parachute from above,\NI’ll take my attention off from my feet. That’s a sneaky trick to catch me\Noff my guard! However, now it’s clear. Shadow Possession Jutsu is one in which other shadows are used\Nto get your opponent, a skillful technique! She’s dodged this trick too… Not careful enough in the final stage. And his opponent is fairly analytical. She’s good at thinking ahead. If this battle takes too long, the shadows in the arena will grow,\Nand his territory will increase. I’ll defeat him with the next one! Should I make a diversion\Nwith Clone Jutsu…? Now his shadow is… Okay! Clone… N-No way…! My... body is…?! At last…\NShadow Possession Jutsu is a success! What?! What’s going on…? That boy… How much is he planning ahead…? That’s Shikamaru’s skill. Why…won’t my body move?! The shadow shouldn’t\Nhave reached this far. I'll let you take a look behind you… T-This hole…! You saw it too, didn’t you…? That hole is the hole Naruto\Nburrowed and flew out of. So it’s connected to the\Nbig hole in front of you. I didn’t expect that…\Na shadow in a tunnel of a hole… Right. Pure and simple,\Na calculated chess move. So his purpose to make Temari measure\Nthe limit of the shadow several times was to lead her to his final trick\Nof using this hole. Temari battled on the outside\Nof the limit of the shadow that she measured and followed, but he caught her from behind,\Ntrailed by the shadow she couldn’t see… There is no escape from this. I-It can’t be… The attack that he used\Nwith the jacket, was it a device to lead me\Nto right this spot…? Was that an underplot too?! Why that--?! Checkmate with the next one. My body is moving on its own!\NI can’t resist it! Before anyone knew it,\Nthey fell under the spell of this match. That guy with no mark\Nis quite a darkhorse. Yes! You did it! Go! Shikamaru! Check… Good grief… I give up! What?! See I told you…he’d give up. Ino doesn’t know anything\Nabout Shikamaru. W-What did you say?! I’ve used too much Chakra from Shadow\NPossession Jutsu in rapid succession. I can’t hold it another 10 seconds. I thought of the next trick 200 times. But I’m out of time… This has become such a pain. Doing one match is good… That guy is a strange one. The winner is Temari! One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two! He kisses and hugs everyone\Nrandomly and says “I LOVE YOU” Three! Masala masters Yoga\Nbut hates curry Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole! All over the world, the sky’s smiling,\Nso look up and smile too Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!\NFight! Fight! Fight! One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes\Nhis time for digging black ships Two!

Thanks for your business! Jeez, I’m fine! Naruto, even if it looks like you’ve healed\Non the surface, you’re still battered. It’s not like that!\NI have to train and get stronger!

At this point, the only person who\Nwould be able to stop Sasuke… who would be able to save him… Is you…Naruto… All I did…was cry…\NAll I did was totally rely on Naruto. I didn’t do anything myself. Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke\Neven if it meant his life… What can I do for Sasuke now…? I just have to put my life on the line\Nand do it! It’s futile. The ropes are made\Nof a maiden’s black hair. And the knot is a Shinobi\Nreverse butterfly knot. It won’t be easily untied. Give me a break.

Oh… Sorry, Sakura… I’d like to get moving immediately\Nif possible, but… He has astonishing recuperative power,\Nbut overdoing it is a big no-no. I’m okay! Be a little more patient! Just wait a little longer!\NI’ll keep my promise, no matter what! No… It’s okay… Up until now,\NI was totally reliant on you… and I did nothing, so… What’s the matter, Sakura…? Did something happen?! No… I'm was relieved\Nto see you doing well. This time, I’ll do my best. Sakura…? I heard you snuck out of the hospital. Do you want to train that badly? Pervy Sage…? My…apple! Well well, things look\Nlike they’re going smoothly. Don't you worry.\NI’ll train you hard right away. Umm…about the training. I was wondering if you could\Nwait a little while longer. Hmm? I’m not saying I don’t want to train. But I remembered some\Nodds and ends I need to take care of. Oh? Odds and ends, huh? Come on. Please? Come in! Oh, I’ve been spotted, huh? I’m guessing, you want to peep? No matter how long you wait,\NI won’t show anything. Wh-Who’d peep at an old lady?! N-No, I take that back! Actually, I’ve come to make\Nan earnest request to you as the Hokage. Talk. This time, I’ll do my best. It couldn’t be that Sakura’s going to… This might be…my last look… Sakura… How did you…? I know what you’re thinking! That there’d be nothing\NI could do even if I were to go…! But I hate myself just standing here\Ndoing nothing! Always being a hindrance to\Nand taking advantage of everyone… Not being able to do\None single thing respectably… It’s useless to stop me! I won’t stop you… You should do it until you’re satisfied. But…I’m going, too. But… It’s become just the two of us… But we’re a three-man squad, right? Yeah. You guys… Oops! Pervy Sage? This person…is Jiraiya,\None of the legendary Sannin? If you, without permission, go out past the border of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves... you know at least that you’ll be sent\Nto prison as Rogue Ninja, right? It’s no use stopping us! I won’t stop you. You’ve been given a mission\Nby Lady Hokage. You’re to investigate and report\Non the Land of Rice Paddies where the Village Hidden in Sound is\Nand where Sasuke has been taken away. The mission is set to be carried out\Nin a group of three. As of now, you will work under me.\NYou got a problem?! It seems they’re the biggest of fools. They won’t stop even if you tried. At this rate,\Nwe’ll lose two important subordinates! You’ll recognize it as a special mission with the goal of investigating\Nthe Village Hidden in Sound, right? I have no choice, huh…? But I have a condition. Bring the two back alive. Got it? Sure, even if it costs my life. It’s too dangerous of a mission even\Nwith that Jiraiya going with them… Sasuke… That’s the Land of Rice Paddies where\Nthe Village Hidden in the Sound is. It’s that Orochimaru’s headquarters. Take sufficient caution and proceed. It’s kind of anticlimactic… Here I thought a bunch of\NOrochimaru’s followers would greet us! Is this really the Hidden Sound Village? It seems to be a peaceful,\Nquiet and nice land, but… No, we still haven’t entered\NVillage Hidden in the Sound. This is the Land of Rice Paddies. Land of Rice Paddies? It’s a small land that’s nothing special. The feudal lord was a foolish lord who\Nhungered for powerful military strength in order to make the land\Ndisproportionately larger. And then Orochimaru probably won favor\Nwith some fast-talking… Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn’t\Nthinking about making the land stronger. He just had an ambition to make himself\Nstronger and to carry out revenge… That’s why there’s nothing in this area\Nthat points to his presence. Really? And so, Pervy Sage…! Don’t call me Pervy Sage! That’s right…\NHe’s one of the legendary Sannin, so… He’s just a lady-loving\Nperverted Pervy Sage! What?! More importantly,\Nwhere’s the Village Hidden in the Sound? Beats me… I don’t know… What?! We don’t know where it is,\Nso we’re going to investigate, right? You’ve got a point, but… But how do we find it? There can’t be a place where\Npeople are without food and ladies. People gather where\Nthere’s food and girls! – Where people gather, there's news.\N– There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit. He’s planning to sow his wild oats\Nunder the guise of a special mission. First off, finding a traveler’s town with\Nlots of hot ladies is the top priority! Every land should have a traveler’s town. Lodging This is a traveler’s town…right? Looks like nobody’s living here anymore. No, I feel the presence of people… And the smell of face powder! – Naruto, take it out.\N– Take what out? Don’t act as you don’t know! In anything one does,\Na war chest is necessary, right? What! Are you after my wallet? Man! What?! This shouldn’t be it!\NTry jumping! Huh?! No! Stop! One, two, three… Is this all you got? That’s all of it, really! – Here… 					– Huh? It’s not much, but please use it. No! Sakura, there’s no need for\Nyou to give that to him! But, it’s money for\Ngathering information, right? Right-right. This should be enough. You guys go on ahead to the outskirts\Nof the post station and wait! Wh-Why? It’s too dangerous ahead from here.\Nlt’s a mission for adults. Hmm, the smell of\Nface powder’s from here. Welcome… Along came a sucker just begging\Nto be parted from his money. We should be able to pulverize him. Food and Drink! And young women! Even if you give the Pervy Sage money, he’s just going to sow his oats without\Ngathering any information, anyway. Sow his oats…? Y-Yeah…\NI don’t really know about it, but… You know, make-out blah-blah-blah… It’s fine!\Nlf I can be of at least some help… I’m always a hindrance\Nwho can’t do anything, so… It’s not like that! In the first place,\Nif you hadn’t taken the action… I’d still be tied to the bed! Brothel Even in different lands,\Nthere are young women everywhere. So? Why don’t we move to\Nthe room in the back? I want to talk more relaxed. Nice, nice. Then first, settle up the tab\Nfor here, okay? What, am I already drunk\Non this cheap drink…? Aren’t there like three too many zeros? You like to joke, do you? If you value your life,\Nleave all you’ve got on you here. I see how it is. Master Jiraiya’s late. I’m sick of waiting. Naruto! Who’s there?! Who’re you?!\NAre you one of Orochimaru’s followers?! What? Was I wrong?! Damn it. That kid had erased his presence\Nuntil he’d gotten that close. I won’t let him get away! Don’t move! Wh-Why?! Makibishi Spikes! Naruto! Wh-What?! – Hold it! You jerk!\N– We won’t let you get away! Naruto, what’s that?! Pervy Sage? What did you do?! I’ll tell you later!\NAnyway, let’s get out of here! Why?! Companions of the person just now? If they’re Orochimaru’s followers,\Nwith my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I’ll… No, no! Don’t get the wrong idea! They’re just bodyguards from a rip-off bar! R-Rip-off bar…?!

That’s some kind of creature! Is it a caterpillar?! What?! Get it off. No, this is an animal. Let go! Give me a break. You guys, have you ever heard\Nof the legend of Onbaa? Onbaa? I’ve never heard of it! Shizune! You don’t know? Nope. Is that legend something like\Nan old tale or something? That’s what I thought, but… Long ago when I was young,\NI heard about a legend… A legend about a dangerous,\Nhairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa who lived deep in the mountains\Nnear the village… One day, that idiot Jiraiya\Neagerly went into the forest saying he was going to investigate\Nthe Onbaa for his summer vacation\Nindependent research. The Pervy Sage? Yes… Are you an idiot? Do you seriously think\Nthere’s an Onbaa? Well, you’ll get yours when\Nyou see my independent research! Who would? Even if there were an Onbaa,\Nit wouldn’t deal with you… You said it! Flat-chested girl! Who’s flat-chested?! No way is there such a thing\Nas an Onbaa! You wanna bet on that? Yeah! I’ll bet! Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya. Huh?! Then, I’m off to wrestle\Nwith an Onbaa! And? Did the Pervy Sage\Nmeet an Onbaa? When he came back three days later, he said he won with\Na force-out move… which most likely was a lie. Oh! here it is. Huh? What’s this? What lousy writing! You’re one to talk, Naruto. Let’s see… The Onbaa is big.\Nlt is nine-feet tall. The Onbaa is scary. No one is a match for it\Nwhen it gets mad. But I beat it at wrestling. What’s this? The Onbaa’s child likes\Nbeing carried piggyback. They grow up on the parent’s back. What?! What Jiraiya wrote is bogus,\Ntracing the legend as is, but… So there was an Onbaa… Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing, it stays piggyback on my back\Nand won’t get off. What should I do? According to legend,\Nthe child Onbaa considers the first thing it sees after birth\Nas its parent and clings to the back\Nof that person. It seems they grow that way,\Npiggybacked on the parent, until they become an adult. It seems until then,\Nthey never leave the parent’s back. Then, there’s no other way\Nbut to wait until it grows up. You say that, but when it grows up… it’ll turn into a scary\Nnine-foot tall monster, right? What’s up with\Nthat straightforward reaction? Well, it’s a legend,\Nso it’ll probably get off eventually… Don’t be so irresponsible! H-Hang in there, Naruto… We’ll be cheering you on\Nfrom behind the scenes. Come up close rather than\Nbehind the scene, damn it! What is it? I won’t lose, you know! This isn’t a weight, man! What is it, Hinata? Naruto… I heard a strange rumor. A strange rumor…you say? That you…umm…had a child. Oh. You mean this? Huh?! Hinata! Hey! You okay?! Hinata! Hinata, Hinata! Hinata?! What’s the deal?\NYou’re sure an extravagant guy… Oh! Am I going to have to take a bath\Nevery time he pees on me? Ichiraku Ramen You know, we don’t allow pets. The Leaf Village public health\Ndepartment is strict, you see. I missed dinner because of him. Overlook it just for today. But now that I look closer,\Nhe’s cute, isn’t he? So, what’s his name? He’s saying it himself,\Nso I guess Onbu is okay. Onbu, huh…? Doesn’t he want to eat\Nsome Naruto fish cake? Here. Old man!\NGive me a whole roll of Naruto! Coming right up! Ever since you clung to my back, I’ve been getting nothing\Nbut odd jobs like this. Well, I guess it can’t be helped… He’s gotten big…! And so quickly… This is bad! Naruto Uzumaki,\Nyou are assigned a mission for the removal of the mountain bandits\Nfrom Yamabuki Pass! Removal? Hey old lady… Onbu’s gotten big, so you intend to get rid\Nof the troublemaker, right? N-No, it’s not like that. I was thinking you’ve had\Nsome eye-opening growth recently, so. Then, what about the other members? No… Since you’ve shown\Nsuch remarkable growth, a solo infiltration should be fine. Sure enough,\Nit’s getting rid of the troublemaker! This is also fate…\NOkay now, back to work. Thanks, mister! N-Naruto, Naruto. Things are fun when\Nyou’re around, Onbu! That Grandma Tsunade. Don’t think you were able to\Nget rid of the troublemaker so easily. I’ll beat the mountain bandits\Nand finish up this mission lickety-split and the two of us will return\Nto the Leaf Village with pride! Right, Onbu?! Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out! Who’re you, creep?! Who’re you?! What do you want?! I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu! Prepare yourselves! – Say what?! 					– Get him! Shadow Clone Jutsu!\N184.01	02:29:44:16	02:29:45:10	Onbu! Even knowing it’s a clone… I won’t forgive those who hurt Onbu! Heh! How was that?! Die! Onbu! You saved me! Onbu… I owe you my life. Let’s get back to the village quick\Nand surprise everyone! Onbu! No way will I believe that\Nyou’re a dangerous creature! We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team\Nsucceeding the Kiba-Akamaru team! What was that? It’s okay… You’ve got me with you. Onbu?! No, it’s huge! Could it be…you’re after Onbu? Are you Onbu’s mom?! W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him! Onbu! Say something, will you?! Y-You idiot, Onbu! No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea! Onbu, it’s your mom. It’s not my intention! Damn it! I had a rough time of it. If you're a mother, then take better care\Nof your child, really! It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you!\NSo rest easy. Huh? My body got light. Huh? Onbu? You got so big! Huh, wha--?\NWhat’s the matter, Onbu?! What’s the deal?! W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me!\NCan’t you tell?! We were getting along\Nso well just a moment ago! Please remember me! It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki! Oh, yeah! Naruto! Naruto! Naruto! Onbu, look at this! Remember!\NRemember this spiral! Naruto, Naruto! You remember my back you clung to\Nthe whole time, don’t you? Have I…had it? Onbu… I’m tired… This feels kind of good… It’s like I’m being carried piggyback. Onbu… Onbu! Live in good health with your mom. All right! My sides…are splitting! Onbaa is now no longer a legend. They’re thriving in the village forest\Nand seriously proliferating. The stupid eagles carried them in, so. Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?!\NTell me! Who knows?\NAll I did was wrestle with Onbu. Don’t be so mean! At this rate,\Nthe village will be crushed. Tell me! Naruto! Don’t look at me. Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone.

So that’s the extent of\Nthe rumored “Absolute Defense”? How disappointing. I see… You were wearing sand, eh? Your opponent’s not just him! I’m here, too! Th-That attack just now… It would’ve been dangerous\Nhad I not been protected by sand. M-My body is still… I’ll just be a hindrance like this. Annoying sand… You’re first, Gaara.

I think he should still\Nbe okay for a while… I did all I could with the treatment… But there’s not nearly enough\Ninformation about his body. I think it’d be quite different\N if we had something like the medical history\Nand treatment data of his clan. What came out after looking into it was the bloody history of how\Nthe Kaguya Clan became just him… Fools who provoked the great land of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Mist into battle with just their clan\Nand were annihilated. The Kaguya Clan was\Na foolish clan that liked battle. The battlefield was the only place\Nwhere they could be at peace. But it was long ago when\Na simple-minded group that only enjoyed slaughter\Nwas acceptable… The times are different now. Doing something like fighting\Nonly with power against a governed organization\Nlike the Mist… can only be called an act of fools\Nrushing towards death. And then you saved only he\Nwho was the youngest and the most exceptional\Namong the Kaguya Clan… That kid possessed the power that\Nwould be feared even by the fighting clan. So it seems he was kept\Nin prison the whole time. It would’ve been a waste to let him…die. Who wouldn’t want\Nthat rare Kekkei Genkai? He possesses a strong\Nand firm bone structure and a defensive power to\Nrepel all kinds of physical attacks. And if turned to offense… the bones become\Na most powerful weapon. It’s because I’ve fought him once\Nthat I understand this. That sand shield is\Nan absolute defense, no less. And that unusual form… It’ll be okay.\NThere’s no way it’ll be broken! It’s hard… I gathered minerals with\Ngreat hardness from the ground, applied pressure with Chakra\Nand mixed them into the sand. You… that unusual Jutsu… It’s the Kekkei Genkai, right? The Kaguya Clan… The ability which now\Nonly I possess. The last one of the clan, eh? Then it’ll die out here today. Indeed, that might happen. Due to sickness,\Nmy body will not last so long… But, the clan will not die out. Besides I’m not alone. This is the “Earth” Curse Mark… With this… I can become a part of you,\NLord Orochimaru. Let’s get everything, Kimimaro. And let’s see the truth of\Nthis world together. Yes. You’re my “Vessel of Dreams.” I’m counting on you. They are presents from me.\NI hope you like them. Would you rather…die or obey? Obey… You will! Is this the best a team\Nof four can do? I’ll ask just once more… Which would you rather choose? Very well… As of now, we’re the Sound Ninja Five. Not alone, you said…? That’s right… As an existence shouldering\None part of Lord Orochimaru’s ambition… I will remain inside\NLord Orochimaru’s soul… for all eternity. Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…? You’re a pitiful guy. I used my big moves too much.\NI don’t have much Chakra. This is the last of it. What an amount of Chakra… You are something… I’ll sink and confine you\N200 meters into the ground. By the pressure of the sand\Nstuck to your body, you’ll soon be unable to move,\Nnot even a finger… You did it…!\NThis time for sure you did it. Dance… Bracken Dance! It is annoying… It feels like a long time when waiting eagerly for\Nsomething you want. Kabuto… Stop talking like\Nyou’re humoring a child! I’m sorry… But you should know\Nthis the most, Lord Orochimaru. Nobody can beat Kimimaro, no matter what hindrance\Nshould appear. Thanks for saving me… Being able to do something like this;\Nvery impressive. All I did was ride the sand\NI’m always controlling. You just have to know how you use it. Lord Orochimaru… I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru… At last… The destruction of\N the Leaf will begin… Third Hokage…\NI’ll teach you a thing or two. Sorry to keep you waiting. What’s the matter, Kimimaro? No… It’s nothing. Even the Kazekage of\Nthe Hidden Sand Village is no match against us. Of course… Kimimaro, it’s thanks to you… Kimimaro! Kimimaro, so you can’t go on, huh? I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru. If I can’t be of use… then there’s no significance\Nto my living. How is your condition, Kimimaro? The “Destruction of the Leaf”\Nresulted in an unfortunate near-miss. But the Sound Ninja Four\Nhave gone to pick up a new vessel… Lord Orochimaru’s new\N “Vessel of Dreams.” Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…? You’re a pitiful guy… You’re wrong… Far from it! There’s no significance to living… But…you might be able to discover\Nsomething interesting by continuing to live… Like how you discovered that flower… Like how I discovered you.

The likes of Kimimaro makes\Nno difference now… Sasuke… I can hardly wait for him. He’ll come here even by himself… I would have been totally hammered. That’s not the case. My sensei said it often… Luck is also a part of strength. That backseat driver? He’s not a backseat driver! It’s because… I wasn’t good enough at that time! I’m grateful for you saving me. But please don’t talk like that\Nabout my sensei! You, too…? When you feel that the honor of someone you revere\Nhas been hurt, you yourself are hurt badly\Nand become enraged. The more important the person\Nyou revere is to you, the greater the feeling… The clan won’t die out…\NI’m not alone. I will remain inside\NLord Orochimaru’s soul for all eternity. That person,\NLord Orochimaru, understands me! What do you guys know?! Fighting for the sake of someone\Nimportant to you… He was also the same\Nas Naruto Uzumaki… But…the person who is important\Nto oneself might not always be “virtuous.” I wonder… There’s no way someone evil\Ncan be thought of as an important person.

If we do that, they probably won’t chase us\Nall the way there! Forecast: Death!\NCloudy with Chance of Sun! Too bad, but you guys won’t\Nbe able to reach that village.

Don’t waste your time fighting me. I have already captured\Nall three of your friends. What? Just hand over the girl. If you do that I’ll spare your friends. Choji and Hinata… So, what are you going to do kid? Naruto… Are you going to\Nabandon me too? Oh no, this princess is\Ntelling you to save her, and let your friends die. Well, I don’t mind that kind of thinking\Nsince it’s the same as mine. Same as yours? That’s right. If someone is useful, then you should make use\Nof them even though they may be\Nyour siblings. There is one thing I need\Nto thank you guys for. Thank us? 					For what?! For doing in Ruiga and Jiga. I was going to put an end to them myself\Nsooner or later anyways. What…?! It was clear that they would\Nsoon tell me, “Big Brother, give us the property\Nand the money too.” Three feudal lords are not necessary\Nin one country. And you still call\Nyourselves brothers?! It doesn’t matter. Even though it’s my parents\Nor my brothers. I'll make use of anything I can. Now, give her to me. I refuse. I see. Naruto… A person who would abandon\Nhis siblings would never keep his promise\Nwith me. Well, that’s true. It’s impossible, Naruto! You don’t even know\Nwhat kind of Jutsu it is! That doesn’t matter! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Take this! What is this guy? There’s something hard around\Nhis body that I can’t see… Naruto! I'm sorry, but none of\Nyour Ninjutsu work on me. Not even one. Damn it! What?! What is that? Crystallized ice…? I can gather water vapor in the air and instantly turn it\Ninto crystallized ice. So the things that just attacked me\Nwere ice Shuriken. Man! It’s hard to see\Nif it’s transparent ice. Just that is not too interesting. What is this great sense\Nof danger? I’m sure his Jutsu has already started! Where is it, where is it\Ncoming from?! Kid, do you know\Ntoday's weather forecast? Weather forecast? Cloudy and partly sunny. It’s a good weather for you to die. What is this? What?! Look out! Damn it! Naruto! That’s a lens! Lens?! Yup, I turned the crystallized ice\Ninto lens to gather the sunlight and shoot it. So, I can’t really control it,\Nbut it’ll be an instant when you die. As soon as the battle condition\Nat the Land of Green is prepared, I’ll burn up the surrounding countries\Nwith this Jutsu. This way! It’s no use. I could even see things that are\Na thousand miles away. I found you. Naruto… Why do you protect me? I wonder why… I don’t know either. Naruto… Haruna! While I distract him, run! Don’t even think you guys\Ncould get away from my Jutsu by doing that! You decided to hand me\Nover the princess? Who would hand over Haruna\Nto the likes of you! What a fool. I’m telling you that if you hand me\Nthe selfish princess and just go back to the village,\NI’ll let your friends go. I promised with Hinata that\NI will save Haruna! Just to keep a promise\Nwith your friend, you’re gonna risk your life to fight\Nin a hopeless battle, huh…? You’re just like the feudal lord\Nin Land of Green. A good-natured big fool! Same as my father…?! You’re just like the feudal lord\Nin Land of Green. A good-natured big fool! Same as my father…?! This is what the feudal lord\Nfoolishly said to us who were trying to take over\Nthe Land of Green: “Please do not torment the people\Nin this country.” I beg you! I don’t care what happens to me, but please promise me one thing! This is a small weak country\Nsurrounded by big countries. Without the powers of the people,\Nthe country cannot prosper! In order for the country to prosper, we must take care of\Neach individual people and not sacrifice a single life! I want you to consider the people\Nas a family and not torment them. I am the feudal lord! It doesn’t matter what I do\Nto the people, right? That’s why… That's why this country has\Nbeen at peace until now! Peace doesn’t matter to me. All I need to do is use the people\Nas the stepping stones and feather my nest! And because of that kind\Nof good nature, his daughter was taken\Nas a hostage! What do you mean?! It seems like it was ten years ago. A lot of the people were sacrificed\Nby the pressure of the big country… Riots occurred in the country\Nand the country came close to corruption. It was a bitter decision… I had no choice but to let\Nmy daughter, who is more important than my life,\Ntaken as a hostage. I know that Haruna will\Nnot forgive me… A cold-hearted father who sacrificed\Nhis own daughter just for the peace of the country. Why don’t you ask\Nyour daughter directly?! In the after life! My father was…killed! What an outrageously\Ngood-natured person, huh? You’re wrong,\Nhe was a great feudal lord! Naruto… Listen! There are two kinds of human beings\Nin this world. Those who use others,\Nand those who get used! In my case, I will get to\Nthe top using anyone, whether it’s my parents or my friends. You! I’ll never forgive you! Shut up! D-Damn…! Die! Naruto… You can’t move anymore?! You’re not the one… It was because of Haruna’s father\Nthat this country was peaceful… The person who is going\Nto succeed this country is… The person is… Haruna! Stop! Stupid! Why aren’t you running away?! Kill me! If you kill me,\Nyour goal will be fulfilled, right?! Naruto, Naruto has nothing\Nto do with this! So both the parent and daughter\Nare naïve, after all. Why not complain to your father\Nin the afterlife for making you sacrifice your life\Nfor the country? How scary… Y-You! It’s time for you to die, kid. I’m not a kid! My name is Naruto Uzumaki. I’m not going to hand over\Nthe Land of Green to a person like you! Naruto! Die! What?! No…way… But kid, it’s too late even\Nthough you took me down… The Land of Green without\Na feudal lord will collapse due to the war between\Nthe large countries over its territory. It’s too bad,\Nbut that’s not gonna happen! Shizune! It’s a pain,\Nbut we came to get you guys! Shikamaru! But…I didn’t ask you guys\Nto come get us! But you look pretty beaten up. No no, this is… Naruto! Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou! Everyone was safe! Yeah. We were rescued by\Nthe people of Leaf Village. Huh? Oh yeah,\Nwhy are you guys here? We received notice of a coup\Nin the Land of Green and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me\Nto come… Princess Haruna’s father was\Nvery kind to Lady Tsunade and me. My father…? Please forgive us, when we arrived,\Nyour father was already… I see…I’ve caused\Nso much trouble for you. Damn! The position of the feudal lord\Nthat I finally got a hold of… But, then the surrounding countries\Nare not going to stay quiet. It’s okay. An announcement has been sent out\Nto the neighboring countries in the name of the next feudal lord. Under your name, Princess Haruna. Then we don’t need to worry about\Nthe country getting attacked anymore! Haruna! Haruna… Do it. You want to take revenge\Nwith your own hands, right? I’ll do the same if I were you. I am…not like you! Haruna… Kikunojou, please forgive me. Princess Haruna. Here, Kikunojou could look over\Nthe Land of Green. I'm sure that Kikunojou\Nwill watch over everyone forever. Well, Lady Haruna,\Nwe are leaving now. Thank you, Naruto, Choji,\Nand Hinata. Shizune, I’d like to ask a special favor. What is it, Princess Haruna? My role is to take over my father’s will\Nto protect the peace of Land of Green. In order to do that, I want to borrow some help\Nfrom the Leaf Village. Our help? Yes. I want you to lend me Naruto. Huh?! Please, Naruto. Princess Haruna. I want you to help me\Nwith the revival of the Land of Green. I…I… I’m sorry,\Nbut I can’t really do that. I need to go back to my friends. And I need to do more training\Nand become much stronger. There are things that I must do. It’s all for my precious friends!

You’ve been told to train,\Nhaven’t you, Naruto?! Grandma Tsunade! That… The Treasure Hunt is On! I won’t let you through! Goal! Too bad.

Our first mission in a while! Treasure hunting? That’s right. This person here,\Nan old acquaintance of mine, is our client this time around… My name is Agari Kaisen. Please look at this. This is a map indicating\Nthe location of the treasure. It seems a treasure worth several\Nhundred million ryo lies buried there. S-Several hundred million?! If I were to eat Ichiraku’s\Nspecial portion ramen everyday… I don’t think you could eat all that\Neven if you spent your whole life eating… Awesome! But it’s on the map, right? Is this a job to go to the trouble\Nof asking Shinobi to do? Yes. The treasure is in a location\Ndifficult for ordinary people to get to. Even I tried getting there…\Nbut there was no way. So it’s the Shinobi’s turn, huh? The deadline is in three days. If you succeed, there will be\Na special reward from Agari. Set out with caution! – Yes! 					– Yes! Heh!

If you fail… you will go back to the Academy! – What?! 					– What?! You’ll re-enroll in the Academy and re-do your Ninja training\Nfrom square one. Wh-Why us…? I looked up your mission success rate\Nover these past few months… Naruto! You’re decisively poor! What?! In particular, the success rate\Nwhen you team up with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga\Nis hopelessly low! Now that she mentions it, it’s the members we failed\Nan earlier mission with… We also failed before when\Nfour of us, including Shino, went looking for Bikochu Beetles… Something rings familiar, right? But, just Naruto aside, why should we also have\Nto go back to the Academy…? Collective responsibility is fundamental\Nin Ninja teams. Everyone takes responsibility\Nfor a failure. Got it?! It…it’ll be okay. No way should we fail\Nat hunting for treasure… If you don’t drag us down. What?! Don’t you be dragging us down! If we fail… we’ll have to study\Nwith these kids, right…? Hey, what’s up? Naruto, Kiba, Hinata,\Nall three of you together? Iruka Sensei… You guys must have come\Nto miss the Academy, huh? You could come back if you like. I’ll never go back! What’s with them…? I’ll make this mission a success\Nno matter what and put Grandma Tsunade\Nto shame! And I’ll have no part of\Ngoing back… to the Academy on account\Nof associating with you. The failures until now\Nare a collective responsibility. It’s not just my responsibility! I don’t know about that. The success rate of our team\Nwithout you in it is high. Then I’ll prove on this mission who it is who really drags us down,\Nbelieve it! That’s just what I want. I wonder if this will be okay? It’s a dead-end! So this is as far as\Nthere’s a path, huh…? There’s a river up ahead.\NHow should we cross it…? Then, here here.\NWe should cut straight through, right?! Are you an idiot?\NMountain terrain isn’t that simple. I would go…this way. Are you an idiot?\NThat’s totally the long way around. Then you want to compete\Nto see which is faster? No way will I lose! All right! The finish line\Nis that boulder! Start! Let’s go, Akamaru! This will be a cinch! What? What? Wait, Naruto! Naruto… What? It seems we’re climbing up\Nquite a bit… It’s okay! Naruto! It’s…okay. We should be totally faster than Kiba, so…! Yes! I win! Something smells good… Huh? So you finally made it, huh? Kiba! You were so late I went ahead\Nand got some food ready… Now then… which way? We should…\Nwe should just cut right though this! Naruto! Good grief… W-Water… Here, water. This way’s definitely faster! I sure slept well. Akamaru and I often\Ntrain in mountains like this… We know a lot more about\Nthe mountains than you guys. Shut up! Shut up, I say! Don’t be acting all big just because\Nyou won two or three times! Not two or three times.\NFive times! S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba! Naruto and the others\Nshould be there pretty soon, huh…? This mission looks easy at a glance. But it won’t go that easily… They’ll probably realize that. A limestone cave, huh…? But… Geez, hurry up already! You said the buried treasure is\Nin a limestone cave, right? Just a minute! The limestone cave is supposed\Nto be further ahead. We shouldn’t have been able\Nto find it this easily… It’s not like there are\Nthat many limestone caves! So here’s fine… Let’s go, Hinata. R-Right… H-Hey, wait, you two! I can’t see anything… Oh, it’s a dead-end… It can’t be! Naruto! Hinata! Look out! Run, you two! Wha--? This…couldn’t be over… That person said it’d be okay\Nat just this extent… What happened…? By any chance,\Nwas an enemy after us? No…Akamaru’s saying\Nhe didn’t smell anyone. It was probably just an accident… I told you this wasn’t the right place! But, as a person,\Nif you’re looking for a limestone cave and there’s one right in front of you, one would usually think\Nthat’s the place, right?! Don’t be getting smart with me.\NHere I saved your butt! I didn’t ask you to save me. What?! Hey… you two… A shard from the ceiling\Nhit you, huh…? You okay? It seems I’m the one\Ndragging us down… Not at all!\Nlf I had been more cautious… At the end of the day,\Nit’s your fault, Naruto. Kiba! Nevertheless, I’ll have no part of\Ngoing back to the Academy on account of associating\Nwith you, Naruto… Akamaru and I will find the treasure. What’re you saying, Kiba?! There’s no point if\Nwe don’t all do it together! I’m…okay, so… From here on, there will be locations\Nall along the way so rough they are beyond comparison\Nto those up until this point… It’ll be nothing but places that\Nreally only a Shinobi can get through! It’d be absolutely impossible\Nfor someone with an injured leg. Oh… Besides… we can’t just leave someone\Nwho’s injured, right? We need someone to stay with her. Then it doesn’t have to be me… Can you find the treasure by yourself? You can’t read a map worth a damn\Nand you don’t know the mountains… To be straight… we’ve wasted a ton of time\Non your account, so! Rest easy. After I find the treasure, you won’t have to go back\Nto the Academy… Let’s go, Akamaru! H-Hey! Wait, Kiba! Damn it…! Now. Naruto! Huh? Are you awake, Naruto? Hinata… Naruto! There are…two Hinatas! Naruto… Naruto… Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu? Could it be… you were twins?! – No! 					– No! Then… One of you transformed into Hinata\Nwith a Transformation Jutsu, huh…? I can’t…tell you apart at all… I’m the real one! I’m the real one! Your voices are also\Nexactly the same! I know. At a time like this, I should ask a question\Nthat only the real one knows. I'll come right out and ask!\NWhat’s Hinata’s father’s name? – Hiashi Hyuga.\N– Hiashi Hyuga. Oh, yeah. As for me,\NI didn’t know Hinata’s father’s name. What?! – Naruto… 					– Naruto… At a time like this,\Nif Kiba and Akamaru were here… Here they could tell by smell\Nwhich one is the real one… Nope. It’d be impossible even\Nfor a Ninja Hound… What? This isn’t just an ordinary\NTransformation Jutsu, so… Mister…As I recall,\Nyou’re the client this time around… What are you doing here? It wasn’t buried treasure that I wanted… It was your faces. Faces…? I already got…your face… I’m Naruto Uzumaki! That’s…me… I guess I’ll be setting out\Nto get the last face… Leave it to me! This is the place… This inside of the cave\Nis as the map says… There’s no doubt. It’s under this rock, huh?\NI’ll go in one shot! Huh? This, huh…?\NI found it surprisingly easy. What is it, Akamaru? Kiba? That’s you there, isn’t it, Kiba? Kiba…? Naruto…Hinata… I told you guys to go\Non back first, didn’t I?! Come on! Come on! Here we went\Nto the trouble of coming! This mission is for the three of us, so… Hinata… is your injury okay? Yeah…I became able to move\Nafter resting a bit, so… Wow! You already found\Nthe treasure?! Then let’s take it back\Nto the village quick! Right… Wait… How did they get here\Nso fast without a map? And moreover,\NNaruto has zero sense of direction… And Hinata has an injured leg… Akamaru…doesn’t seem to be feeling\Nany particular suspicion. Am I being paranoid…? It seems they’re back. Kiba! Akamaru! Heh! Didn’t we tell you? Even a Ninja Hound's nose\Ncan’t tell the difference… Let’s begin. Face Copying Jutsu! What’s that…? We also copied faces like this. As you can see, when performing\Nthe Face Copying Jutsu, the person being copied\Nmust be close by. And moreover,\Nit takes a degree of time. But once a face has been copied once,\Nit’s an impeccable Transformation Jutsu that is beyond even\Na family’s recognition. No way… Kiba! Wake up! Kiba! Wh-What the hell are you…?! I’m Kiba Inuzuka. You guys… What’s the big idea?! Kiba! Kiba! Those are the real ones, huh…? Who the hell are you guys? The name of our clan\Nis the Kedouin Clan. We’re a clan that possesses\Nthe secret Face Copying Jutsu. Why our faces? We’re going to return to the Village\NHidden in Leaves in your place, and mess up the village good! The wind blows, Ah… The pain,\NThe memories won’t disappear What should be brought along? Assemble them into a piece. There is no second chance, never How foolish it is to throw away Acting so innocently, Ah… The images. It probably will not end It probably will not end Burn that love-filled heart, Sail across a thousand dreams Running freely To take hold of the world in hand The clouds scatter The sun sets yet again The solo parade begins to move. Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising, Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love Like I said, nothing good ever comes from\Na mission together with you, Naruto. This isn’t the time to be complaining. They’re intending to\Nhead for the village. Then, how do we get out of here? – Listen.\N– With Rasengan, I’ll… No good. They’ll notice. – I can…\N– Then use your Fang-Over-Fang. – It’d be the same, you idiot.\N– That's why I said… – Then, what do we do?\N– Use that, I’m telling you… Naruto! – Don’t stop me, Hinata.\N– Don’t stop me, Hinata.

Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart This is good! Bit by bit,\NI'm figuring out the timing... He read my movement. No way could he do that! Darn! 					We were so close...! Naruto, can you still move? Of course! I'm totally fine! He's pretty much spent...\Nand it's no wonder. Shadow Clone Jutsu uses\Na lot of Chakra. But thanks to him,\N we found our way out. I found the way to break through! Hah! Impossible! That was just a coincidence. Naruto! Run! Run out of here and\Nattack from the outside! A-All right! You won't be able to…! I-I'm not going to lose! There! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Darn! T-That was good just now! What? We're doing it one more time! All right! It's likely that there's a limit\Nto that guy's Chakra, too! To prove that,\Nhe's little by little… This won't go as you've planned. First, I'll get you! Sasuke! Darn! It's been a while since\NI've fought in such bad conditions. And I'm worried about\NSasuke and Naruto, too... Be calm…Think...\NWhat will he come after? Oh no! What?! Too late! The Broken Seal That was Sakura's voice! Did something happen? What's that Kakashi doing? Sa…kura… Darn it… I must do something… I'll do something about it… T-This guy... Here I go… It's pointless to struggle. Naruto, behind you!! Naruto! It's impossible for you\Nto get out of here. I mean it. Can you stand up, Naruto? Y-Yeah… From now on,\Ndon't waste your Chakra! You're playing right into his hands. I know. Darn it! If things continue like this,\Nit's going to be really bad. I... I have to do something. Strangely, my eyes have adjusted… It's about the time I put\Nan end to this for you… What?! Stand up, you idiot! I'm aiming for a vital spot...\Nbut he's parrying all of them . I know…\Nyou're so persistent! A coincidence…\NNo, that's not it. On the contrary, he's fighting\Nwhile covering for his friend. Surely, my movements… That boy…he can see something. What in the world...? Okay, in that case... He disappeared. Where, where did he disappear to?! Naruto! Don't faint! I can't take care of you\Nany more than I am now! Who asked you to take care of me... It seems that kid has\Nreached his limits. Tsk... Amazing…\NThat's an amazing move. You move well… Wha--?! But I'll stop you\Nwith the next one. Motor function... Reflexes...\NAbility to judge a situation... All of these things…\Nshould be at their limits! He's coming! Calm down… Focus! And … 					See everything! He saw through absolutely everything?! No way… Those eyes… It can't be… Sharingan… You are… Only a little, but... I was able to see! So, you also have the power\Nof Kekkei Genkai… What a kid… It's not perfect yet, but to think that in the middle of a battle\Nhe was able to rouse this power… If that's the case,\NI can't fight him too long… This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra. There are also limits to retaining\Nthe teleportation speed. Besides, the longer the fight continues, the more my movements will enter\Ninto the range of his ""reading."" In fact, his eyes\Nhave already captured me. It would be foolish to aim\Nstraight at him. In that case… I'll use that kid to lure him in! What?! Let me make it in time! K-Kakashi Sensei! You were late entering\Nto guard, Kakashi. Your whole-hearted intent to help\Nthose kids has gone to your head, and it seems to have clouded\Nyour Sharingan with even heavier fog. Even though you have\Nthose impressive eyes, your ability to read your enemy's\Nmovements is getting cloudy. Amuse me more, Kakashi… I want to repay my debt in\Nan amusing way. Don't worry. Anytime now,\NHaku is going to defeat those kids. You better apologize to them\Nin tears when you are in ""the next world""\Nfor your lack of strength. Sasuke will be defeated…? That's not true! Sasuke is… Cha! Not by that guy! Cha! He won't be defeated! Cha! Naruto won't either! That's right. Huh! I...believe in their strength. Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,\NKnucklehead Ninja… And Sasuke is a member of\Nthe most excellent clan in the Hidden Leaf Village! That can't be! Yes…\NHis name is Sasuke Uchiha… He bears within his body... the famous Kekkei Genkai\Nof the Uchiha clan! He's a Ninja genius. He's the remaining survivor\Nof that tragic clan?! No wonder he grows so quickly. But... That's the same as Haku. Nobody has ever beaten\Nthat secret Jutsu of Haku's Not one person in the past… Well then… It's about time I settled this too, huh. Sakura, don't move from here. Uh... ah…okay! No, I'm going to put\Nan end to this! For God's sake, you… just won't quit…\Ndragging my feet, will you? You did it! 					Sasuke...! W-What kind of expression\Nis that… You…idiot…! W-Why?! You protected me…?! How the hell…should I know? Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Hmph… You... I hated you… Why? Why…? Why…me…? I didn't ask for your help!! I don't know… My body moved…of its own accord… Fool…! Sasuke! That man… Until I defeated…my brother… I absolutely refused to die... That's what I decided, but... You, don't die… He… To protect someone dear to him… he would plunge in\Nknowing it was a trap… He's a Shinobi worthy of respect. Is this the first time you faced\Na friend's death? This is the way of the Shinobi… Shut up! Even though I...\Nhated you too… I won't forgive you… I'm going to kill you! What is this Chakra?! It can't be… For Chakras to be tangible like that… A-And…what a ghastly Chakra that is… The wound on his hand…\Nlt's healing instantly… This boy… Who in hell is he…? Is it Zabuza…? No! This sinister Chakra was once… It can't be! What is…this Chakra? It feels foul… Kakashi?\NNo, it's too big to be Kakashi's… Who is it? Naruto…! Oh no… At the time like this… The seal has broken…?

We underestimated you,\Nthinking it was kids! I never heard that story! Nice, Sakura! I don’t quite get what’s happening,\Nbut oh well… – Please forgive us!\N– Please forgive us! There’s no use talking… – O-Oh no! 					– S-Stop! It’s the same as three years ago! This time, we're hung by just one rope,\Ncombined with the same movement. By the way, who are you guys? – And he doesn’t even remember us!\N– And he doesn’t even remember us! Hey, Kakashi Sensei. Yeah? What is behind that mask? What? You wanted to see\Nwhat’s behind this mask? Yeah! Then you should have said\Nthat from the beginning… Well, can you show us? I don’t mind… What the--?! Sure thing. All right… Is it like cod roe? Buckteeth? Or a tiny mouth? Behind this mask… – Behind that mask…\N– Behind that mask… There happens to be another mask! – What?! 					– What?! What--?! What in the world is that ?!

But, we can… A person who knows village matters\Nvery well gave us information on where and how to attack. Knows village matters very well… It couldn’t be! You mean Orochimaru?! Who knows…? Well, that’s how it is,\Nso we can’t have you guys living. Umm, can you see this? Paper Bombs! We’re going to detonate\Nthe Paper Bombs after we’ve left here… There’s nowhere to run… There’s no chance of someone\Ncoming to save you. Prepare yourselves. It’s better than going back\Nto the Academy, isn’t it? Umm, rest in peace. H-Hey! Just a minute! Farewell, real me. Run, Dodge, Zigzag!\NChase or be Chased! It should’ve just been\Nhunting for treasure, but to think this would happen… Sure enough,\Nnothing good comes of being together with you\Non missions, Naruto! This isn’t the time to be\Nsaying stuff like that! They’re attempting to mess up\Nthe Leaf Village by impersonating us! Then how’re we going\Nto get out of here?! Well… If I use the Rasengan,\NI could somehow… They’d notice that! It’d be the end if we were\Nto get ambushed outside. Then, with your Fang Over Fang… That’d be the same, the same! You moron! Then what should we do?! – Umm… 					– Huh? If I use\Nmy Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms… I get it! With that we can weather this crisis\Nwithout the guys outside noticing! If I could just loosen\Nthese ropes a little… Leave that to me! N-Naruto?! All right! Me, too! Kiba… Akamaru… Just a little more… It snapped… Protective 8 Trigrams… 64 Palms! Now then,\Nshall we go as arranged? – Kiba! 					– Yeah! – Hinata! 					– Yes! Naruto! I know! Hinata! You okay? Oh…! What…? Hey, Hinata!\NCut our ropes before you faint. Right. It seems the guys outside\Nare gone. It doesn’t look like this place\Nis going to hold up now. It looks like it’d be best for us\Nto escape as soon as we can. What’s that?! It’s the buried treasure chest. Leave it be! It’s a fake anyway. And there might be\Nsome kind of trap set. But it’s our mission to\Ntake this back with us, so… There really might be\Nburied treasure in it, right?! Byakugan! It looks empty inside…\NWait, there’s paper inside. Isn’t it a Paper Bomb? It doesn’t seem to be\Nanything dangerous… Then I guess I’ll take it for now. Come on, there’s no need\Nto go to the trouble of… But it might make for a good mark\Nto distinguish him from the imposter… I get it. Akamaru, you’re the mark for\Nthe real me, so stay close to me. There’s no time. I’ll be going with our Fang Over Fang.\NMake sure you keep up! R-Right. Man-Beast Clone… Fang Over Fang! You okay, Hinata? I’m fine… I just have to follow\Nafter Kiba, so…I’ll be o… Hinata! All right! You okay, Hinata? Naruto! Does your leg hurt? Kiba… If your leg hurts, say so first. I was thinking\NI must not cause trouble, so… Actually, that is trouble. I’m sorry… Surprisingly, this might be\Nthe weakness of our team. Huh…? Hinata shows too much\Nconcern for us. Naruto and I speak too bluntly to\Neach other and we get into fights… N-Now that you mention it… If we’d take on our missions while\Nbeing a little conscious of stuff like that, we might…\Nbecome a pretty good team. Got it! I’ll try… All right. Then Naruto and I will go\Nafter those guys. Hinata, you come later.\NYour leg’s hurt, so don’t force things… Got it. Listen up. You’re hurt, Hinata.\NSo you follow later. I just said that, didn’t I? Huh? Did you? Right…Thanks… Let’s go, Naruto! I have to hurry, too… I’m back! You’re back, Naruto? We couldn’t catch up\Nwith them, huh…? Naruto? Kiba?! Was I here just now?! Y-Yeah. That one was an imposter! Say what?! But the dog didn’t notice anything… He can’t be sniffed out even\Nwith the nose of a Ninja Hound! Akamaru was fooled, too! We’ve got trouble!\NTo the Hokage, immediately. Right! Akamaru! You remember the smell\Nof that Agari old man, right?! After him! Lady Tsunade! We’ve just received\Na communication…! Nobody realizes it. Stay sharp.\NOur mission isn’t over yet, so. That’s right.\NThe crucial part comes now. Someone’s coming! We found you, imposters! We’ll kick your butts! Oh-ho… So you’re alive… Naturally! This time it’s your turn\Nto prepare yourselves… After all, this is our home field. There are times when you lose even when fighting\Non your home field! We won’t let you get away! H-Hinata?! I’m going to inform the Hokage! Naruto, you go after the imposters! Got  …it. Hey… Upon careful thought,\Nthe real Hinata hasn’t come yet…! You imposter! What the…?! What’re you doing to Hinata?! It’s just like I’m the imposter. Naruto! What’re you doing?! W-Well… He’s an imposter! What?! Prepare yourself, imposter! Hey! Wait a minute…! Hey, you’re also an imposter! Even if you can copy\Nthe appearance and scent, you can’t go so far as\Ncopy Ninjutsu, right?! Let’s go, Akamaru. Fang Over…? Knocked out…? No way. It was just a punch,\Nand I didn’t even use a Jutsu… Come to think of it… I was slugged good and hard,\Nbut I didn’t feel it at all. Hey! Weren’t you going\Nto mess up the village?! You guys are utterly weak! Damn it! I’ll catch the fake Hinata,\Nso you handle yourself somehow! Leave me to me! Hold it! Hold it! I wonder if I got overly ambitious\Nand borrowed too many books… Hey, Naruto! You… You moron! You’re butt is so heavy\Nyou fell right on it! Ugly! Ugly! Forehead girl! I’ll kick your butt\Nthe next time I see you! I’ll kick your butt,\Nno matter what! Sakura, get out of the way! Naruto. I’ll kick your butt! Wh-Why?! What? Why’s the Naruto who ran that way\Ncoming from over here? I’m off on a delivery. Right. Take care. What is it?! You okay, Ayame?! Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in… What…? Na-ru-to! How dare you do that\Nto my daughter…?! Wh-What…? I’m okay, Dad. No, you rest a bit. I will have Naruto take the responsibility\Nand make the delivery! What?! But, but I… If you refuse, I’ll never let you eat\Nmy ramen ever again! This isn’t the time for me\Nto be making a delivery! I finished the delivery! Okay! Good work! Where did he go?! My…imposter! This jerk was also weak… Kiba… Stop… 					Forgive me… That might’ve worked on Naruto.\NBut I hate soppy stuff… like that! Did these guys seriously\Nintend to attack the village…? Where are you, imposter?! Come out! Hey! Hey! Could it be that I came here? Yeah, you did. You’ll be paying me for\Nwhat you ate earlier. That jerk…! Forty-five plates… Here. Eating and running with\Nsomeone else’s face… That imposter… He’s not messing up the village,\Nhe’s messing up my reputation. Hey… No way…! My Golden Delicious Ninja Way\NRamen Pure Heart of Fire I’d been setting aside! I won’t allow it…! No matter what, I won’t allow it…! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! – Go! 					– Go! – Where is he?!\N– Where’s the imposter?! – Where are you?!\N– Imposter! Where are you?! Come out! I’ll kill you, imposter! I’ll pay the bill later! – Find him! 					– Where is he?! There he is! Hey! – I won’t let you get away!\N– Got you! – I’ve got you!\N– You're wrong! – Is it you?!\N– I’m not an imposter! Calm down, guys! The imposter isn’t carrying\Na chest on his back! – What? 					– It's not him? – Now that you mention it…\N– That's right. That’s right! Then… It’s him! Yikes! At the end of the day,\Nthese guys were nothing special. Hey, are these guys really\NOrochimaru’s henchmen? Who knows? The Hokage will look\Ninto the details for us. That’s right. Man, I’m tired. My shoulders got stiff from carrying\Nthis thing around the whole time. Naruto! Kiba! Oh, the real Hinata’s come back. Hey, Hinata! Over here! Naruto! He’s not carrying the chest on his back…\NThen this Naruto… He’s the imposter! Gentle Fist! Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto… – What?! 					– What?! A test?! This mission was a test in order to see the teamwork\Nof you three. A Shinobi will often have to\Nform teams with various others in response to the qualities\Nand conditions of the mission. At such times, failing if teamed with\Na certain other person is a problem. And so I gave you a mission\Nthat was easy at the start. And I made it so along\Nthe way… something would happen\Ninvolving a village crisis. At that time, I wanted to see whether\Nyou could handle it as a team. So that’s what it was… That’s harsh! We would’ve died if\Nwe’d made the slightest mistake. It’s okay. I got the story about\Nyou guys from Lady Tsunade. It was set up so even if\Nyou were to make a mistake, you would only be injured. Since this time around\Nyou had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru, I enlisted the help\Nof the Kedouin Clan… so you wouldn’t be able\Nto distinguish the enemy. And? How did these three do? Let me see… They floundered part of the way\Nand I was worried about the outcome… But I shall pass them. In terms of results,\Nthey did capture us, so… Oh yeah. That’s…! It was more or less\Nour mission to bring this, so. With this, our mission is complete. There’s no point in going\Nto the trouble of bringing… No, no. There is something important inside\Nthat I must give to you, Lady Hokage. Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy. You, too. See ya. Yeah. Are they going to look\Nlike that forever? It seems they’ll get their own faces back\Nnaturally in a few days. I see… Wh-What’s this…?! A bill for the recent training…?! Here…he said he’d be glad\Nto cooperate… It comes to this much? This is a hard world to live in,\Nisn’t it? My name is Tsunade… My concern now is a debt\Nthat absolutely will not go down. More like, it’s growing, isn’t it? I shouldn’t have become…\Nthe likes of Hokage…! The wind blows, Ah… The pain,\NThe memories won’t disappear What should be brought along? Assemble them into a piece. There is no second chance, never How foolish it is to throw away Acting so innocently, Ah… The images. It probably will not end It probably will not end Burn that love-filled heart, Sail across a thousand dreams Running freely To take hold of the world in hand The clouds scatter The sun sets yet again The solo parade begins to move. Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising, Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love No, it’s gone, gone, gone!\NWhere’d you put it, Naruto? Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it. You wrote it? And I gave it to\Na Delivery Ninja. You gave it? So it should reach\Nthe other party today. You idiot!\NAt this rate, my life as a writer will… More importantly,\Nlet’s get the training started. Shut up and come with me, Naruto! We have to get that back at any cost! Next time: ""Please, Mr. Postman!""",,,,0.07137131690979004,,,0.06407830864191055,0.10072689879532183
14,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart The Village Hidden in the Leaves. This is a Hidden Village that has produced\Nmany superb Ninjas. – Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?!\N– You're really gonna get it this time! The number one prankster of the village,\NNaruto Uzumaki, is a boy who is also\Nstriving to become a first-rate Ninja. I don't care! Transform! His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu. –You fool!\N– However, Naruto had a secret inside him. – Stop making idiotic spells!\N– that even he didn't know about. At one time, the nine-tailed fox drove\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves to the brink of destruction… That nine-tailed monster fox is\Nsealed within Naruto's body. – Look at that one.\N – Therefore, he's been abhorred – I hear he's the only one who failed.\N– as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen\Nif he becomes a Ninja. Okay, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations on your graduation. However, that Naruto, – Iruka Sensei!\N– on my sufferance, – That hurts!\N– graduates from the Ninja Academy. Say cheese! He starts off on his first step as a Ninja. Ninja missions are conducted\Nby three-man cells. Sasuke Uchiha. A descendant of the Uchiha clan, a distinguished family in\NHidden Leaf Village. He is a boy towards whom Naruto harbors\Nintense feelings of rivalry. Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi who\NNaruto has the hots for. As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missions\Nwith these two rookie Ninjas. The one who observes and\Ninstructs them, Kakashi Hatake,\Nalso known as the Copy Ninja, is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja. One day, Naruto's group takes on\Nthe mission to guard Tazuna, a master bridge-builder\Nof the Land of Waves. All right! We're off! However, Tazuna is targeted by a man\Nnamed Gato who attempts to control\Nthe Land of the Waves. Stop your darned grumbling…!! – Next time I'll kill him with...\N– And Gato had hired a terrifying man – head chopper!\N– for Tazuna's assassination. Zabuza Momochi… A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hidden\Nin the Mist. He was a man who had excelled at\NSilent Killing and had successfully carried out\Nmany assassinations. Naruto and the gang have\Na tough time of it in the face of Zabuza's attacks… Hey! You, with no brows… Record in your Bingo Book\Nabout the man who'll one day become\Nthe Leaf Village's Hokage. Naruto Uzumaki!! It's not so easy! A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow…! However, the shoe is on the other foot, thanks to Naruto and Sasuke's\Nclose team work. Kakashi copies\NZabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan. – W-What's that?!\N– It breaks Zabuza's composure.\N78	01:05:42:24	01:05:44:29\NMe...? R-Ridiculous! Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)? The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!! No way! It's over… A Tracker Ninja boy\Nfrom A Hidden Mist Village is the one who delivered\Nthe final blow. I must get rid this corpse\Nbecause it contains many secrets. Now then, please excuse me. However, this boy, Haku... was Zabuza's comrade. Will you be all right the next time? The next time… I'll be able to see right\Nthrough the Sharingan. Kakashi who has inferred\Nthat Zabuza is still alive, gives Naruto and gang… – Ready!!\N– new training in preparation...\N96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23\N– Here I go!\N		– for Zabuza's second assault. And then, 					One week later... This mist… Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming! This means a rival has emerged, Haku. So it seems. The time has come! Secret Jutsu… Crystal Ice Mirrors! Now then… I'll start. Take this! Naruto Uzumaki… is finally here!! The Number One Hyperactive,\NKnucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight! Now that I've come, you're all right! Oh… Naruto! The hero of a story generally appears\Nin this kind of situation and takes out the enemy in no time! Heh… That brat, eh… He's long on talk... Man, that idiot! Making such a conspicuous entrance… There's no point if you don't\Ncatch the enemy off guard! That boy… What're you doing in a place\Nlike this from morning? Training!! Why are you training? I want to get stronger! All right, here I go!\NShadow Clone Jutsu… Huh?! Oh, no! Huh? Get out of the way, Naruto! Whoa! What?! He's saved… To think the enemy attacks\Nwould cancel each other out… That was super lucky… Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?! Hey! What kind of idiot\Nwould attempt to cast a Jutsu directly\Nin front of an opponent?! What?! The essence of a Ninja is deception.\NHow you deceive your opponent. Even casting one Jutsu,\Nyou avoid the eyes of your opponents, catch them off balance,\Nand outsmart them… The way you made your entrance earlier,\Nthat's just you coming to be a target… N-Nooo. But I went to the trouble\Nof coming to the rescue. What concerns me more than that is… That guy… Haku… What's the idea? Zabuza, leave this kid to me… Please let me fight this battle my way. What did you say…? So you mean no interfering…Haku? You're naive…as usual… I'm sorry… Naive, eh… True enough… Judging from these wounds, there's no mistaking that\NI was attacked with a Senbon. But no vital areas have\Nbeen targeted so far. Does he mean to half-kill me…? If so! As for me, I'll take you out first, so...! It's impossible.\Nlt's too much for Naruto! I should be the one to… Hey. Don't get any ideas… If you move, you know what'll happen\Nto that old man, right? True… If I move away from here and\Nhead towards Naruto, Zabuza will kill Tazuna. No way can Sakura completely\Nprotect him by herself. How about it? Let's just see how those young guys\Nfight against each other. That mask… You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,\Nweren't you! You've got nerve to deceive us! I'm sorry. But, your teacher also said it,\Ndidn't he? Things like deceiving and\Ncatching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty. Please don't take it personally. You don't have that luxury, either! Huh? Sasuke? I haven't…forgotten about you. Here I thought he had disappeared…\Nbut he was there… I would rather you had\Njust gone down quietly. But it looks like it won't work\Nthat way. Fine. I'll put an end to it first. H-Hey! Naruto. I'll get to you later. W-What's with him…? This is it! So the real body is over there, eh… Okay! I'm over here. He moved…? How?! – Sasuke! 					– Sasuke! What was that just now?! Sasuke's body suddenly got battered… How's he doing it?! What kind of Jutsu is he using…? It's conceivable that he has clones\Nhide in the mirrors and gets them all to throw\Nthe Senbons simultaneously… No, they're too fast considering… What does it mean... not being able to see even\Nthe trajectory of the weapons…? Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu… I don't see a reason for\Nthese ice mirrors… In any case, there's no way to question\Nthat these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks. What I can do is to launch attacks… from both the outside and inside. The thing to do is to figure out\Nthe meaning of the mirror! I'll take care of here! All there is to do is… for me to attack the inside and have Naruto\Ntry attacking the mirrors from the outside. Yo! I came to save you. You okay, Sasuke? Oh… What good will it do you\Nto catch your ally off guard…? Y-You idiot! If you're a Shinobi,\Nyou'll move more cautiously! What's with you?! I came to the rescue, you know! If you also come inside the mirrors… Dang it! I've had it, you fool! Fool?\NWhat do you mean by fool?! As to be expected of the\Nnumber one unpredictable Ninja. He is making the situation worse and\Nworse by coming to aid. Since it's come to this,\Nall that is left is to smash the mirrors! Fire Style! Hey! What're you going to do?! These are mirrors made\Nwith freezing water… If so… Fireball Jutsu! It's not working at all! They won't melt with that\Nlevel of firepower. Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!\Nls it the clones? Where's the real body?! It's useless for you to even\Nattempt following with your eyes. I absolutely will not be caught. Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Don't! If so, I'll find out which is\Nthe real body by hitting them all! This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses\Nmirrors that can reflect only my image. Watching you from the speed I move, it almost seems as if\Nyou aren't moving at all… I knew it! Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?! Kekkei…Genkai…? It's the same type as my Sharingan… Deep blood ties…\NLineage of paranormal individuals… A type of Jutsu that is passed on\Nonly through those traits… Then…! That's right… It's impossible even for me\Nto copy that Jutsu… And there's no way to destroy\Nthat Jutsu, either! Darn it… So…what?! I can't die here yet. 'Cause I have a dream\Nthat I must turn into reality… The dream to have my strength recognized\Nby everyone in the village… and become the Hokage! Dream… Pathetic brat. Brats like you aren't needed\Nby anyone and die without ever knowing\Nany freedom or dreams… You have the same eyes as I do… For me, becoming a Shinobi completely\Nis difficult. If I can, I don't want to kill you guys… And I don't want to get killed\Nby you guys… But if you guys are\Ngoing to come at me… I'll kill my feelings with a sword and\Ncompletely become a Shinobi. This bridge is the battleground\Nthat connects each of us to our dreams. I, for the sake of my dream. And you, for the sake of your dreams. Please don't hold it against me… I want to protect the person dear to me… I work for the sake of that person,\NI fight for that person, and I want to make that\Nperson's dream a reality… That's my dream. For the sake of the dream,\NI will completely become a Shinobi... and kill you guys! Crystal Ice Mirror defeated! Cuz' I've finally discovered the way\Nto break through it! Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke. Let's pull out of this place and\Ngo assist Kakashi Sensei. I've had this bad feeling from\Na while ago. Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow\Nuntil we get there.

163,"I want to try and gather\Nthe unrestrained winds I’ll run toward the horizon,\Nalongside the wave crests I’ve made my decision, even if there’s a long way to go\Non that road. I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? Is this really Moso’s house? Here he’s a superintendant officer, so I thought it’d be a more luxurious\Nbuilding with gold folding screens. Your voices are too loud. Lord Moso is a magnificent person\Nwith no self-interests. So he lives frugally. But you know, he’s an old man who’s the second most important guy\Nin the land next to the feudal lord, right? He smacks of being really poor. Naruto! Well well, how shameful of me\Nto present such a poor residence. Lord Moso. What?! This old man like from\Nsome dumpling shop? I’m an old man from\Na dumpling shop? Geez, unbelievable! Idiot! What’re you doing, Neji?! Well, make yourselves comfortable. So you are Ninja who came from\Nthe Village Hidden in Leaves? From the right,\Nthis is Naruto, Neji and Tenten. I hear you encountered\Nthe Cursed Warrior that appeared in Lord Komei’s residence last night. Yes. So, how did it go? Did you figure out the true identity\Nof the Cursed Warrior? Yeah, it’s a real ghost. Oh, a ghost, huh? Don’t be jumping to conclusions\Non your own. But he appears all of a sudden\Nand flies around. Yeah, and on top of that,\Nthe inside of his armor was empty. No matter how bizarre the thing,\Nthere’s always a trick. I’ll pin down the true identity without fail. That is encouraging… We have just changed feudal lords\Nand the public is still anxious. Please eliminate the rumors of\Nthe Cursed Warrior as soon as possible. I beg of you. Please! Tsurucho Yakitori Here are your chicken wings. Oh, here we go! They look tasty! Hot! That Moso superintendant officer\Nseems like a good guy. Yes. It was also Lord Moso\Nwho came to my rescue and selected me to be a page. The son of the feudal lord succeeds him and an excellent superintendant officer\Noffers him tutelage… The government appears\Nto be stable, but… Then why is there a strange rumor\Ngoing around about the haunting\Nof the previous feudal lord? There’s probably somebody displeased with this dramatic replacement\Nof the feudal lord. Do you have any idea who it might be? Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all. Isn't that the name of\Nthe tactician you were talking about who wanted to become the feudal lord? Then why did the Cursed Warrior\Nappear in his residence? Perhaps to deflect attention. That’s it. 					I bet that’s it. All right, since it’s come to this, if we can nab that old man\Ncalled Komei or whatever and quickly get him to own up… Guys, let’s get fired up and\Nget going! Idiot. We can’t do something\Nlike that without proof. He is a tactician of this land\Nmore or less, so. Oh man, that’s no fun. First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,\Nthe feudal lord. That’s not possible. Lord Sagi\Ndoes not like to meet anybody. Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.\NLet us meet him, okay? You’re a “nipple” friend, right? If you’re going to say that,\Nsay, “childhood friend.” Huh? Can we really meet him\Nin a place like this? This lake holds fond memories\Nfor Lord Sagi. And…for me as well. In our young days, Lord Sagi always played with\Nhis little sister Lady Toki here. He might come here around about today\Nwith his attendants… If we’re lucky. It’s up to luck, huh? It’s Lord Sagi. Lord Sagi, we have arrived. Thank you. Oh wow…\NSo that’s Lord Sagi, huh? He’s cute. He is kind of my liking… My watch has remained stopped\Nsince that time. Hey, what’s he doing? He’s probably reminiscing. The only thing that can comfort\NLord Sagi’s heart is his memories with Lady Toki. Byakugan. Where is it? Where’s this bloodthirsty aura\Ncoming from? It’s not above ground? Could it be, underwater…? Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi! I don’t think so! Who the heck are you guys? Damn it!\NI won’t let you get away. Wait, Naruto! What is it? A letter bomb in the water. That was a close one. If you’d chased after them as is,\Nyou would’ve been totally entangled. Settle down. Lord Sagi! Are you all right?! Yes, I’m fine. Thank goodness! Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja\Nfrom the Village Hidden in Leaves… They came to investigate\Nthe true identity of the Cursed Warrior. That was unnecessary.\NI bet it was that  Moso’s idea? It was all because\Nhe was worried for your life, Lord Sagi. The fact is, if these people\Nwere not here now… Silence. Y-Yes, my lord. Hey-hey, do you really not get\Nhow this guy feels?! Chishima was seriously\Nworried about you. Without his passionate friendship, the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t have\Ntaken action with that low commission fee. I am not obliged. How bothersome! Say what?! Friendship is in the past. I became a feudal lord and\Nhe is a mere page. We are now standing on\Ndifferent surfaces. Say that again! I’ll slug the guy\Nwho tramples on friendship--! Let it go, Naruto. What’re you doing?! Let go of me! I have to give guys like this\Na good thumping! You are talking about a feudal lord! It would have been better\Nhad it pierced my throat. Go. Yes, my lord. Jeez, who does he think he is?! Jeez, a feudal lord. Please forgive him. What? You don’t have a problem\Nwith being told off like that?! He wasn’t like that in the old days. His father and little sister\Ndied in succession and he became cold-hearted. So that’s what it was. I’m sure the day will come when he will turn back into\Nthe kind-hearted Lord Sagi. I don’t know about that. The Shuriken from before. This is an odd shape. Hm? Let me have a look. Oh! Does it look familiar to you\Nor something? Y-Yes. There are no Ninja\Nin the Land of Birds. But there are guardsmen\Nreceiving special training. Is it a weapon those people use? Yes. Who commands those guardsmen? The person who organizes them\Nis Lord Komei the tactician. Say what?! Komei again. Komei must have originally thought to\Nmislead the public with the Cursed Warrior and attempted to create\Na rift between Lord Sagi and Moso. But the relationship between\Nthe two is tight. And by Moso summoning us here,\Nhe probably sensed that the day was approaching when the truth\Nbehind the incident would be revealed and he plotted\Nto assassinate Lord Sagi. If we’ve figured out that much,\Nlet’s charge on in--! Hold your horses, Naruto. We have to find more hard evidence. Hey, is that how it is? Yeah, that’s how it is. Neji, look at that.

Damn it! No good. This thing’s not just a ghost, after all. A tornado? I can’t see the Cursed Warrior! Byakugan. A Shuriken Shadow Clone?! 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation! What’re you letting your mind drift for?! Sorry… I never thought a ghost could\Nuse Ninjutsu. It’s not a ghost inside the armor.\Nlt’s a Shinobi. And quite a wily one at that. This is the same shape\Nas the shuriken from this afternoon. He’s an important witness.\NTake him alive. Leave it to me! But we can’t take him alive if we don’t do something about\Nthat tornado.

But you said you didn’t feel such\Na presence in the first Cursed Warrior. Yeah. Hey, what does that mean? In other words, the two Cursed Warrior\Nare separate beings.

Well, the one that’s probably\Ndelaying things is… either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot,\Nor Kidomaru who likes to play. But the one that’s\Nthe most dangerous when he loses his temper\Nis Sakon. He’s not satisfied until\Nhe kills his opponent, even though he should\Njust leave things be. He thinks he’s the strongest of\Nthe four, so he shows off. I wonder if that’s so… Tayuya has a personality that’s\Nneck and neck with Sakon. But in any case,\Nnothing bad will happen since we sent that kid… Kimimaro.

What?! You’re saying\Nwe’re gonna do that?! No, Akamaru! It’s too dangerous to do it here\Nwithout our comrades! You understand, don't you? If we use that Jutsu, both you and I will use up\Nmost of our Chakra and won’t be able to move. If we miss, we’ll die here in vain. Akamaru… What a pitiful master I am…\Nthat you had to bite me.

One more shot of\NWolf Fang Over Fang. The next one is our limit. We’ll take them down with this! Wolf Fang Over Fang! It’s no use hiding! I told you we don’t chase\Nwith our eyes!

Remember this. It’s not just Jutsu that are weapons. I’m counting on you, Shikamaru. Hang in there, Sasuke. But that kid, how wonderful it is that\Nhe can move with that body, eh? Kabuto, I don’t know what kind\Nof order you gave him, but it’s a bit harsh. Not at all.\Nlt wasn’t an order. I don’t like to force things. He acted on his own. For you whom he reveres.

And he sanctified you. And he fanatically admired\Nand revered you. Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan\Nwith the strongest and perfect bodies being the legitimate bloodline\Nof their Kekkai Genkai… until a short time ago.

What does Orochimaru want to do…?\NWhy’s he after Sasuke? Lord Orochimaru has already\Nobtained Immortality Jutsu… A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu\Nand obtain everything in the world. What does that have to do\Nwith Sasuke?! “Immortal” doesn’t mean that\Nthe flesh is being maintained as is… Before his body decays, a strong and new flesh will be made\Ninto a vessel for his soul. That’s… Are you saying that’s Sasuke?! Yes… That’s right. I won’t let such a thing happen! Idiot… What will come of sending\None shrimp punk in pursuit? And looking at things\Nin terms of time, up until now you probably sacrificed\None member each time in order for the group\Nto move forward. Is that guy called Sasuke\Nthat important? How many of your men do you intend\Nto sacrifice for the sake of just one person? You incompetent punk. Heh… Indeed… For me, this is my first mission\Nas a platoon leader. It’s very disquieting having\Ncomrades gradually whittled down, and I didn’t know if my own judgments\Nwere correct or not. As a squad leader with\Nthe lives of the party in my hands… respecting the lives in\Nthe four-member party, rather than the life of one person\Ntaken by the enemy… and deciding to abort a mission\Nthat’s too dangerous, would be by the book. Then, why didn’t you do that? The world doesn’t go\Nby the book very often… Since not one person in my squad\Nwould do something like abandon a captured comrade and give up\Nfighting for the sake of their own safety. Me included. Being the cloud-loving loafer myself, I am not cut out to be a squad leader\Nwho gives orders to comrades. The only thing I can do for them...\Nis to have faith in them. Listen.

But… Not all humans can\Ntolerate Curse Marks. No way, there’s no way\Nthat Sasuke could be… That’s right, Sasuke wasn’t able\Nto tolerate the Curse Mark and so he died. That's a lie. It has to be a lie! What would telling a lie\Nlike that accomplish? To someone that’s going to die…\NAs you are? If you want to see him that badly\NI’ll let you see him. When you die, you can see him\Nin the other world. Sasuke… Sakura! Sakura, don't you believe… what a guy like him says! Naruto! So it’s Naruto, I thought you’d drowned\Nand died a long time ago but… When I make a promise\NI don’t give up. That's my Way of Ninja! I ain't gonna die,\Nuntil I get Sasuke back! This is interesting! Sakura, go hide! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I’m over here! Hey stupid, over here!\NOver here, over here! Where’re you looking?\NI’m over here! Over here! What’re you doing? Hey! So you’ve used up all\Nyour Kunai Knives… I’m gonna…completely blow you away! How annoying! Fire Style: Misty Flames Dance Jutsu! – Ouch! 					– That’s hot! – Yikes! 					– Oww! You’re too slow! Rasengan! Naruto! Since you and Orochimaru are here, it means Sasuke is probably here too! Tell us the truth right now! Wh-What the heck?\NMy body won’t move… Have a good look at yourself. Wh-What’s this? Those are Chakra Threads. Chakra Threads? While you were attacking earlier, I wrapped the thread around you. Take a good look at where\Nthat thread is connected. That’s right. Those Chakra Threads are… connected to my heart’s\NChakra Network. And Naruto, the thread that’s\Nwrapped around you is connected through my Chakra Network\Nto your organs and to your heart. See, can you hear that? My heart and your heart will\Neventually become connected as one! – Damn! 					– Naruto! It’s no use. That thread is formulated\Nand spun with Chakra and it will absolutely not break. Now our hearts are\Ncompletely synchronized… The Chakra which passes\Nthrough this thread via the Chakra Network from my heart\Nis controlling your heart ,you see. It’s no use, even though\Nit’s my heart… If my heart beat gets faster,\Nyour heart will get faster too… And when my heart stops beating… you will die too! Don’t! If you stop your heart,\Nyou’ll die too! That’s right.\NBut that doesn’t mean much. Since I’ve already promised\Nmy body to Lord Orochimaru… Wh-What the heck are\Nyou gonna do?! If I crush this heart… you will die too! If I crush this heart… you will die too! Now, together we will… Naruto! How’s it feel to have\Nyour heart seized? It’ll be all right… You’ll be out of your misery\Nright away! Stop it! How foolish, if you kill me\NNaruto will die too. What I’m gonna cut… is this! There’s no use you know, It’s impossible to cut thread formulated\Nand made from Chakra. Even Lady Tsunade’s great strength\Nwouldn’t be able to break it. What should I…\NWhat should I do?! Naruto is suffering right\Nin front of my eyes and yet… I can’t do anything! Sakura…! I…absolutely will not lose! Until I’ve fulfilled my promise! You bravado ends there. Now, shall we die together? And go to the place where\NSasuke is waiting? Naruto! Sakura! – Sasame?! 					– Sakura… Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife! Naruto! Naruto! Naruto?!\NHey, are you okay? Naruto! No way… It can’t be… No way! Naruto! Ahh… My chest right now\Nis beating with joy. Idiot! It was a waste for me\Nto have worried! Sorry, Sakura… You’re so worthless! That’s right, Sasame!\NWhy are you here? Well, it’s… I was saved by Sasame,\Nyou know. Me too. What do you mean? Water came rushing into that\Ntrap pit we were in earlier… That’s it! The lid to the pit! Damn! When the water reached\Nthe ceiling, I desperately tried to open the lid,\Nbut wasn’t able to escape… I was told by Master Jiraiya\Nto go to where Hanzaki is. But I got concerned about Arashi,\Nso I came… Naruto! Hey! Thanks! Th-The frog spoke…! Well, come to think of it, there’s no way you could open the lid\Nof the trap by pushing on it. Geez! But how come the thread that\NI couldn’t cut with the Kunai Knife, be cut when I wrapped it\Nwith Sasame’s tag? Because the Chakra Thread\Nis a Secret Technique within the secrets of\Nour Fuuma Ninja Technique… Of the Fuuma?! Oh I see…\NSo who the heck is this?! Oh! She is…from earlier! Mistress Kagero… She’s a Fuuma Jonin. Sasame! Sasame… I was resurrected\Nby Lord Orochimaru… You! You’re being tricked\Nby Orochimaru! Where is Sasuke? And Arashi?\NWhere’s Sasame’s cousin! Lord Orochimaru is… going to raise our Fuuma clan… to the center stage\Nof Shinobi again. You’re still talking about\Nthat stuff?! At least tell Sasame the truth! So it’s there! He’s in there! Sasame and Arashi…\NYou two were so close… Then it’d be better\Nif you didn’t see him. Mistress Kagero … What do you want to do, Sasame? Do you want to wait here? I will see him!\NNo matter what’s in store for me! I came all the way here\Nto see Arashi! Yeah! You’ve got guts! All right! Let’s go together! Yeah! Let’s go! Sasame… There might be some sort of trap… Leave it to me! Orochimaru?! Good of you to come, Sasame… Why…? Arashi…! Arashi! Arashi? I’m no longer… Arashi… Wh-What the heck is going on?! The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin\Nwere combined into one… and I’ve been reborn as\Nthe ultimate Ninja you see… Now, I’ll show you\Nmy ultimate Ninjutsu…Sasame! No… Arashi… Damn, Orochimaru!

You too, Lee… Is your body all right? Kakashi! Kakashi Sensei! Oh! Sorry, sorry. You must’ve been worried.\NSorry for not contacting you at all… Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad… I don’t really mind that. It's hard to see from here… Sasuke… Kakashi Sensei… Hm? You know about the mark\Non Sasuke’s neck, don’t you? Is that…? No need to worry. A mark? So, that’s that. Yup! One… Two… Three… Four… Five… Six… Seven… Eight. Eight of them… There are eight members of\NAnbu Black Ops in this spacious arena… Two platoons are too few… What’s Lord Hokage thinking? Well…without knowing how or when\Nthe opponent would make their move… It can’t be helped that the Anbu\Nare dispersed and deployed in important areas in the village. Huh? It’s about to begin. We shouldn’t let our guard down,\Nbut for now… We need to pay attention…\N to this match. Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking out\Nwhat sort of training you gave him… as your eternal rival! Huh? Did you say something? No! You’re slick, Kakashi! Why are you always so avant-garde?! Both of you, to the middle! Begin! So this is the sand\NKakashi told me about… Please don’t get so mad… Mother… What’s he talking about…? Earlier… Earlier I had you suck\Nawful-tasting blood. I’m sorry. But this time it’ll likely… taste good. His conversation’s started.\NThis is dangerous. This is the first time I’ve seen Gaara\Nget like that before fighting. So it must mean his opponent\Nis that imposing… Him. It appears he’s calmed down. Come on. Hey… Do you remember…\Nwhat he said yesterday? At that time… I will kill…you all without fail. Just wait. That’s what he said… But he didn’t do it. It was the perfect opportunity, but… he didn’t even see us. Now, let me feel it! We're… unsatisfactory for him. Right now, the only one who\Ncan make him feel anything… …is only Sasuke! I live fighting for only myself\Nand loving myself… And if I see that all other people\Nin this world exist only to make me realize that, there could be no world more wonderful. Naruto… Here we go! The Sand Shield became\Na Sand Clone! He’s fast! This guy…\Nis just like that guy… He’s fast! It’s nearly the same\Nas Lee’s ordinary speed. And… It's overlapping with the image… of my Taijutsu! Is that the Sand Armor? Come on! Thank you, Anbu man. So apparently, Hinata will be\Nall right for now if she rests. Oh, is that right? Huh? You know this person?\NWhat‘re you taking about? This person is an Anbu… Not that, but at the examination…?\NWhat do you mean? Well, this is what it means… Come on! If you’re not gonna come at me,\NI’ll go at you! He’s fast! What’s the matter? Is that it? A-Amazing… That armor…I’ll tear it off. His speed is basically the same\Nas Lee’s with the weights removed. It’s… It’s exactly like\NLee’s Taijutsu. His speed is also completely\Ndifferent from before! Sasuke… You are indeed\Na genius beyond imagination. How many years did it take me\Nto attain that speed…? And you attained it in a mere month…! However, it seems to consume\Na lot of stamina to continue that movement. What’s Gaara planning to do? The sand armor uses up too\Nmuch Chakra… It can’t last for very long. What the heck sort of training\Ndid you do?! Hm? To get to that level in a mere month… Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsu\Nwith Sharingan. So during the Taijutsu training… I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements. Sasuke could make\Nthat movement his own only because he knew Lee. Of course, Sasuke had to\Nwork very hard for it. But…with only that… With only Taijutsu…\Nthat Sand guy can’t be taken down! That Kakashi… He must have seen the battle between the hateful Gaara\Nand the lovable Lee. Taijutsu that was taught suddenly can’t work against an opponent\Nthat even Lee couldn’t take down. He should have known this only to well. So if that’s the case… Why is it that he had Sasuke\Nmaster only Taijutsu?! Why did I keep living? But as long as you’re alive,\Nyou need a reason… If you don’t have one,\Nit’s just the same as being dead. What's this guy saying?! So this is the answer I came to… I am living in order to kill\Nhuman beings other than myself. After living in the fear of never knowing\Nwhen I might be murdered, finally, I became calm. Oh? Shikamaru… We need to go over to where\NKakashi Sensei is right now! What’re you planning to do? Hey! I'm going to… stop this match! Gaara couldn’t possibly be planning\Nto use that Jutsu! So he used all the sand for protection… I didn’t think there could be this\Nmuch of a difference in the hardness with a difference in the density\Nof the sand. So it’s absolute protection. The sand…\Nlt’s covered his entire body. This is somewhat troublesome. Now, how will Sasuke proceed?! Kakashi Sensei! Naruto! Huh? What do you want? Sensei!\NPlease stop this match right away! That guy is totally different from us! He’s not normal! Naruto… 					What’re you saying? He lives to kill people. In any case… If this continues, Sasuke will die! Jin, Saru, Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru… There’s no mistake about it.\Nlt’s that Jutsu! This isn’t good!\NOur plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind. Shoot! Kakashi Sensei!

Hinata… Naruto… I promise that\NI’ll return to rescue you…! But, there is a huge difference\Nin power between him and me… I could never win against him! He’s already caught up to me…\NWhat should I do? This is…iron sand…? I see…his Jutsu can\Nchange his body and the things he touches\Ninto magnet. The reason why he didn’t attack\Nback there was to brush off the iron sand\Nfrom his body… If he doesn’t,\Nhe would sink in his iron sand. His attack pattern consists of\Nalternating between Ninja Art Magnet\Nand Iron Sand Genjutsu … He does this to turn\Nhis magnet powers on and off so his body won’t\Ncompletely turn into a magnet. Then, there is one way\Nto beat him! Now…play time is almost over! Now, it’s time you give up! I would never give up! Because that is my Ninja Way! What a waste… How dare you do that to Naruto! I will definitely not forgive you! Once you say where\Nthat girl is, why don’t you live with\Nthat brat in hell! Hey, don’t be shy\Nand come closer! Right now! I’ll risk everything\Nin this single attack! An attack that didn’t work before, will never work! Is…that right? What?! We're both going to hell! Let go, you! You brat!

I will go by myself. Wait. 					I will go too. I promised Hinata that I will\Ndefinitely protect you, princess! With Hinata…? She fought with\Nthe second Janin and got hurt badly.... Hinata did…? You guys said that you didn’t accept\Nthe mission of protecting me. Then, why do you concern yourselves\Nwith me? I… Not only me,\Nbut Hinata and Choji, too. We don't like it when somebody before us\Nis hurt or sad… That's all. Well, let’s go! If we pass through the valley\Nahead of us, we’ll get to the town. If we do that, they probably won't\Nchase us all the way there! Please be careful… No one uses this deer path. This should shake them… I found you! It’s impossible…\Nto run away from me! Choji?! Don’t make useless efforts… I’ll make you guys my hostages! You guys take them back to the castle! Yes! If you wander around me you might get caught\Nin my Jutsu and die. That’s it…\NWe’re almost there! There’s no time to waste!\NLet’s go! Okay! Haruna! I’m okay! Oh no! Wh-What is this?! I see… You have good sense\Nto dodge that attack! Who is it?! 					Where are you?! Here, over here! Too bad, but you guys won’t\Nbe able to reach that village. Since you guys are going\Nto die here! Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone.

Now, let the tenth round begin. Do your best! Fatso! Damn it! Those two better watch out! I’ll end this match quickly and\Nturn you into mincemeat! Then let's not play around... I’ll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso. You bandaged cucumber roll! I know his Achilles heel all too well\Nfrom my last battle with him. Those holes in his arm emit\Na pulsing sound, so… Ninja Art! Expansion Jutsu! Followed by the\NHidden Leaf-style Taijutsu! All I have to do is to prevent him\Nfrom aiming at my ears! Human Boulder Jutsu! Hooray for Big-Boned! Good! Squash him, Choji! This guy can attack sonically without\Neven touching the opponent… But that’s only when ears are showing! With Choji’s whole head buried,\Nit’s like he’s wearing ear plugs. how does anyone make a sonic attack\Non a meat ball, let alone one that’s rolling? The way you are…\Nyou can barely move, can you? That’s where I attack! It’s no use, I’m wearing ear plugs. No, this is the end! Oh?! The human body is made up of 70% water,\Nand water is able to transmit sound waves. In other words, your whole body is like\None big ear. And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu! Lord Orochimaru…no, Orochimaru! I’ll have you know that...\NI’m more than a mere guinea pig. Are you all right? I-I want to eat meat… Oh man...\NAnd the guy went easy on him, too. Although he lost, the least we can\Ndo for him is take him for some BBQ beef. It’s finally over. At long last, the Final Round… With this, the preliminaries for\Nthe third exam is completed. A Shadow in Darkness:\NDanger Approaches Sasuke I wonder what’s happened to Naruto? Let’s go outside now. Iruka Sensei hasn’t been alert recently,\Nso now’s our chance. Hey! Konohamaru! You intend to sneak out again, do you? I-I need to go to the bathroom! Liar! To everyone who has advanced to\Nthe Final Round of the third test of the Chunin Exams, there’s one person who’s missing,\Nbut, congratulations. Sensei… Hmm? I have a question. About Sasuke? Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know much. But don’t worry too much. From here on, it’s up to Sasuke. Sakura, I have to step out\Nfor a moment. Please inquire about the\Ndetails of the Final Round! Sure. Here, in our house,\Nincluding Sasuke who’s not here, we have five Leaf, three Sand, and one Sound. Well, I will begin the explanation\Nof the Final Round. Finally! The preliminary battles have\Nended without incident. It seems they’re now entering\Nthe Final Round. This land really has become\Npeaceful, hasn’t it? This peaceful time has put\Nthis country in slumber... while all the other lands are busy racing\Nto expand their military. Would it be possible for us\Nto take it now? Humph, I suppose. Though, I don’t know how much fun\Nit would be to take out that old man. Is that so? To me, it looks like you are still have\Na hesitation about it. From now on, the power of\Neach Hidden Village will clash with one another in a long\Nand violent manner. The Sound village is also one of them… You intend to be the trigger\Nfor all of that… And use him for a bullet. Our Sasuke…right? You guess well. So well that it’s a bit creepy. Not in the slightest. I still had no idea about\NDosu, Zaku or Kin. In gathering information on Sasuke, I desired to learn their skills and carried out tactless things like\Ndeliberately subjecting myself to an attack. You overestimated me. It seems that you… you don’t trust me completely…yet. Was it necessary to tell you,\Nmy right-hand man, about the likes of those three? You see, therein lies\Nthe very proof of my trust. And because I do… I would like to leave Sasuke\Nin your hands. The Curse Mark that was given to him… appears to have been sealed by Kakashi. Though, that won’t matter much. While there is still some\Ndarkness left in his heart… I want you to abduct him. That’s an uncharacteristically\Nhasty request, is it not? There’s a little something troubling me… Is it Naruto Uzumaki? You’re quite a sharp one,\Naren’t you? Sasuke has lived for revenge\Nagainst his older brother Itachi, and will not rest until he\Nhas achieved that aim. Nevertheless, in battle with me, he was aware that there were things\Nbeyond his power and faced death without fear. I didn’t think he’d be the type of\Nperson who would be in a hurry to die. According to your information, contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has\Naltered Sasuke’s heart and mind. So much so, that he possesses\Nsome influence over Sasuke. The best thing to do is to get Sasuke\Naway from him immediately… And quickly turn him in my color. Well, then… Kabuto… You... If you wish to stop me… You have no choice\Nbut to kill young Sasuke, now. You can’t possibly kill me… Though you are strong, you’re only\Nin the same league as Kakashi. Just kidding… Now, run along. I trust you. That face… I wonder what could possibly\Nbe going on in his head? The Final Round is where\Neach one of you will show off your battle skills\Nin front of everyone. I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate\Nand show off your ability as representative battle forces\Nof your respective lands. Accordingly, the Final Round will\Ncommence one month from now. W-We’re not going to\Ndo it here, right now? This is so that there’s\Na suitable period of preparation. What do you mean? That is to say… Along with the announcement of\Nthe conclusion of the preliminary match to each\Ncountry’s Daimyo and Shinobi leaders, readying the summons for\NFinal Round requires preparation time— not to mention the time it takes\Nfor you examinees to prepare. This old man always has such\Na roundabout way of saying things. I don’t quite get what\Nyou’re trying to say. What do you mean? In other words,\Nin order to know your adversary, in order to prepare yourself,\Ntime is necessary. Time to analyze what you learned about\Nthe adversaries in the preliminaries... time to take stock of your successes. The battles until now were\Nlike actual battles- it presupposed situations in which\Nyou can’t know your adversary. That’s for sure… I never dreamed that this guy\Ncould make sand into a weapon. However, this is not the case\Nin the Final Round. Some of you might have already\Nrevealed everything in front of your rivals… In the spirit of fairness and equality, you will have a month to\Ntrain yourself to further your skills. Now, I can’t be thinking of this as some sort of month-long\Nholiday and do nothing! Believe it! Seriously! Seriously! It might not be good idea to\Nexcel too much, is it? We failed to stay out of Orochimaru’s\Nwatchful eye, and it was unfortunate for us both. Under this gentle exterior,\Na seed of evil took root – and it was this seed that was exploited… Some day, through that Ninjutsu… this child will as well… Kabuto… Who knows? Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke. I have to give it you, Kakashi… Stopping my attack from your blind spot… But, you’d better ready at least\N10 of your men next time. The Anbu that I prepared were\Ntaken out without difficulty… You’re not an ordinary Genin are you? You caught a whiff of me and immediately\Nreadied your weapon… you’re quite impressive. No, I’m not all that. What do you want with Sasuke? Depending on circumstances,\NI’ll haul you off to questioning. I wonder if that’s possible\Nfor the likes of you… Are you looking to take me on? You are the son of the chief of the\NLeaf medical corps, aren’t you? Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi? Are you affiliated with Orochimaru? If you arrest me here now, you might never be able to prove\Nmy connection to Orochimaru. Shut up and confine your answers\Nto my questions. What if I say “No”? I’m the one asking the\Nquestions around here. Now give me some answers. You’ll find out before long anyway\Nif you let me go, so can you make an exception\Njust this once? You, willful little brat… Don’t mess around with grown-ups. Don’t be so arrogant. The circumstances are in my favor… I should have known. A shadow clone! Darn…I've let him escape. Impressive… As I suspected... This is the Dead Soul Jutsu, where one temporarily animates\Nand controls the heart of a dead body. Meticulously transforming even the face… and also stopping his heartbeats\Nand eliminating all traces of his body odor… in order to prepare an escape by\Nimpersonating a murdered Anbu… He wasn't raised as the adopted son of\Nthe chief of the medical corps for nothing. If someone this good is working\Nfor Orochimaru… I can’t stay as I am now… Now that that’s done… I’d like to let you take your leave… But first, for the Final Round, there is one more important\Nmatter to take care of. Let’s get on with it,\Nso we can get to training! Now, now. I want you all to\Ncalmly take one slip of paper from the box that Anko is holding. I’m going to go around in order…\Ntake only one. Good, everyone has taken\Na number. Then, from left to right, tell me\N the number on your slip of paper. I’m eight. I’m one. Seven. Five. Three. Nine. Two. Six. In other words, he has number four. Uh-huh. Very well, I will tell you about how the Final Round\Ntournament will work. Huh? Is that what these\Ndrawing lots were for? Ibiki, bring forth the pairings. Yes, sir. He’s so far away. Is that all the Final Round is,\Na tournament? Shoot! I have one extra round. Vendetta for Choji?\NGive me a break! I’m so relieved to know that\NI won’t be in the same section as Gaara. Sasuke Uchiha… Perfect. Hyuga Neji, right off the bat? This couldn’t be better!\NBelieve it! Sasuke has to go up against him…? Could I ask a question? Go ahead. Does this mean that there will\Nonly be one winner of the tournament? That only one of us will be\Nable to become a Chunin? No, on the contrary. The judges of the Final Round,\Nof which I am one, will be made up of the Kazekage, the Daimyo from various countries\Nwho will assign you your missions, and the Shinobi Leaders. Through this tournament, these judges will be able to make\Na thorough evaluation, and come to a decision as to\Nwhether each one of you possesses the qualities incumbent\Nof a Chunin. Even if someone loses the first round,\Nthey can still become a Chunin. So there’s a chance that all\Nof us will become Chunin? Correct, but conversely,\Nthere’s also a chance that none of you will. To “advance” in the tournament, means maximizing chances\Nto appeal yourselves to the judges. Understood, Shikamaru? This is all a real pain in my… Thank you for your patience. We will adjourn until next month. The second round will either be\NNo Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh? That guy is so strong he kicked\NBushy Brow’s butt. Sand Coffin! I want to fight you, too. Now that it’s come to this,\NI’ve got to see Kakashi Sensei. Umm, where’s the room\Nthat Sasuke’s in? I’m sorry. Mr. Sasuke\Nis not allowed visitors. What?! Hey, hey!\NWhat's up with that?! I’m sorry, those are the rules. Why, Sis, tell me why? Naruto, this is a hospital.\NKeep it down. Kakashi Sensei! Say! Say! I’ve got a favor to ask! You don’t need to say it all. Well, I thought it would\Ncome to this so… I searched for someone\Nto watch your training. Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei! I have some matters to take care of. I don’t have the time to trouble\Nmyself with you. Oh! Aha...! You’re going to train\NSasuke, aren’t you! Well, don't say that. I found a sensei who’s\Nmore reliable than I am! Well…who is it? It’s me! Huh? You! The Closet Perve! Such insolence! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry,\Nand you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? Darn! I’m not satisfied with this! I don't care if you’re elite tutor\Nor whatever, but there’s no way\NI’m not going to get stronger if I’m to learn from the Closet Perve\Nweaker than me! I have to get strong by any\Nmeans necessary, no matter what! If you’re really a strong ninja, just try to convince me\Nwith your sheer strength!

Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha To think it’d be so soon…?! I couldn’t ask for more. For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha\Nhave been selected. No objections, right? - Right!\N-No! The pain won’t go away! It appears the Curse Mark hurts. Don’t use the Sharingan. So you knew? If that Curse Mark on\Nyour neck gets out of control, it could endanger your life. I believe it. Well, the match will be\Ncalled off at that time. I’ll be coming in to stop it,\Nso good luck. Called off, you say?! It seems this Curse Mark thing\Nis responding to my Chakra. In other words, in this match, I can hardly use even\Nmy regular Jutsu, not to mention the Sharingan! However… Yoroi’s ability is\Nthe worst for you, Sasuke. Now then, please begin. You… my Chakra… You just noticed now…? Bushy-Brow's Jealousy -\NLions Barrage Unleashed! You… my Chakra… You just noticed now…? Yes…Yoroi has unorthodox ability\Nto absorb Chakra. It’s a magnificent art that\Nabsorbs spiritual and physical energy simply by holding his palm against\Nan opponent’s body. And, if all of your Chakra\Nis absorbed, Sasuke, you’ll be forced to rely upon\Nthe power of my Curse Mark… Now, release that luscious power…! That is the only way\Nyou have to survive. You…little!

You call yourself an Uchiha with that? Don’t be looking so lame! Give your best! That guy… That’s it! Oh! You can’t afford to be inattentive! I’ll finish you with this! Is this as far as it goes…?

I’m not done, yet! Lions Barrage! There’s no need to check. I’m stopping the match from\Ngoing any further… Therefore, the winner of the\Nfirst battle, Sasuke Uchiha… passes the preliminaries! Yes! Well. Good job… Before that Lions Barrage, your movements were that\Nof Guy’s Taijutsu… So you copied it with the Sharingan when you wrangled that one time\Nwith that Lee kid? Sasuke! You, you… won in a lame way! Look at you, all battered up!\NYou idiot! Man, that loser… Sasuke…Thank goodness. Okay, I’ll win, too! Lee… Because of you,\N I’ve managed to save my neck. Things would’ve gotten hairy if I hadn’t seen your technique\Nin close-quarters combat. But it doesn’t appear to be a technique\Nthat I can use heavily. I see… So before, he copied a part\Nof the technique I only used once? Sharingan! That’s your ability… Sasuke… you’re quite a person. You get rapidly stronger… I kind of…feel a bit of fear. For a sequence of\Nhigh-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements, it’s impossible to acquire this\Nwithout training that whittles away flesh and blood. No matter how much you\Nuse the Sharingan, it can’t just be mastered in\Na short space of time… Moreover, his idea for that\Nfinishing move… Kakashi… this boy reminds me\Nof when you were a kid… Last year’s number one rookie\Nwas Neji Hyuga. This year’s number one rookie\Nis Sasuke Uchiha. I wonder which one is stronger…? Really, he’s something else. To think he’d develop the true power\Nof the Sharingan in situation like this… What’s most to be feared…\Nis the Uchiha ability? That was surprising… To think he brought the Curse Mark\Nthat was getting out of control into submission with his will… Tsk. Again? It just make it more interesting! Yeah! He is Sasuke after all… This is as far as we’ll go… I’m hungry… W-Wow! Nothing special. Magnificent… Sasuke Uchiha... We medics will give you\Nthe best of treatment. You guys are out of your territory. Huh?! I’ll take him under my care… Now, I’ll take you into the back… and seal the Curse Mark. Can we wait until\Nthe preliminaries are over?! I want to watch the matches\Nof those who will remain in the main battle. No! Don’t get so heated. If we let things be\Nany further, the situation might become irrevocable. I won’t accommodate you anymore. Now then, come on… Sasuke… Hm? Sakura... Speaking of which,\Nduring the match… did you see something that looked\Nlike a strange wound on Sasuke’s neck? What? Please promise me… Don’t say anything about\Nthis bruise to Naruto. What? Listen… this is also teamwork. It won’t do to have him\Nunnecessarily worried. I-I don’t know either. I see… Umm, now then… We will get right to it and\Nbegin the second match. Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame Which weakling is it?! Both of you, come forward. We will now begin the second match. That’s the Sound Ninja… The guy who had both\Nhis arms broken by Sasuke! It seems like you’re proud\Nof your arms… You! S-Stop it! He’s going to fight with those arms? I wonder if Shino is going to be okay… He’s fine. He’s strong! What…? I’d square off with anybody except him… Now then, please begin. Now, Zaku… How you fight will be a sight to see… If you fight here,\Nyou’ll be finished… Withdraw! Somehow, this one still works, so… One arm is enough to take care of you! You can’t beat me with\Njust one arm. Stop pestering me! Take this! Slicing Sound Wave! Okay. Hang in there.\Nlt’ll be over right away. Curse Sealing! Next time, even if that Curse Mark\Nstarts kicking in again… the power of this Curse Sealing\Nshould suppress it. However, this Sealing Jutsu makes\Nthe strength of your will its foundation. If something happens like\Nyou not believing in your own strength and that will were to weaken… the Curse Mark will\Nonce again start to rage. Out of character.

That's dangerous!\NVery dangerous! It's okay, Lee! Mistakes come with adolescence.\NDon't worry about it! You're so kind…Sensei! Now then, take a hundred laps around\Nthe Training Field toward that setting sun! Yes! Sensei! Let's go! Yes, sir! Hey, wait a minute. We're still in the middle\Nof the conversation! What're you going to do\Nabout the Chunin Exam?! There's no time! Huh? Oh, that's right… Lee, you will be punished for attempting\Nto break the prohibition on top of fighting… in principle, after\Nthe Chunin Exam. Okay! Five hundred howls of adolescence! Yes, sir! Idiots… Say! Say! By the way, what's with that turtle? If I'm not mistaken, those kids are… Kakashi's… Oh! No, he's looking this way! You guys…how's Kakashi Sensei? You know Kakashi…? I know him all too well. People call us…\Neternal rivals. Sounds like a lie! What're you saying?!\NGuy Sensei really is… That's fine. ""Action speaks louder than words""\Nanyway. Huh?!

How about that?!\NGuy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?! Darn it… This time around,\NLee caused the trouble. Out of consideration for my face,\Nforgive him. Out of consideration for\Nthis pleasant face.

180,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain ♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red? Because I had a sad dream last night. My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ♪ Swollen as I cried… Hey! Neji! Naruto! What happened to those guys? It seems they were attacked\Nby the Shinobi in question… So he appeared again? He took…he took Sumaru away. What? He took Sumaru?! Yeah! Anyway, helping the guys who are\Ndown comes first! We’ll split up and carry them! Got it… Roger! Mizura… Naruto! They were attacked by\Nthe Shinobi in the mask! There are no external injuries…\NThey’re just unconscious. Umm… What about the others? Lee and Tenten are carrying them\Nhere now. I see… Then Sumaru as well…? Oh… Uh… He was taken away by\Nthe masked Shinobi. I’m sorry… He escaped into the Valley of Death… We couldn’t go after him. The Valley of Death?! Did he inhale the gas from\Nthe Valley of Death? No… I put him into a state of\Nsuspended animation beforehand, so there was no effect on his body. I understand using Sumaru\Nto lure that person… But to use a child from our same village… Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease? We’re comrades who have\Nalready dirtied our hands… What’re you doing talking nice now?! We’ll make those Hidden Leaf kids\Nbelieve that Sumaru’s kidnapping was\Nthe work of that person… After we’ve taken back the star,\Nwe can leave the clean-up to them… Hidden Jutsu:\NThe Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku Mizura isn’t feeling well and\Nis taking a break from his training… Byakugan! What’s this…?! Mizura! You okay? You still need to rest… I must not rest at a time like this… I understand how you feel… But you shouldn’t push yourself too hard! I’m fine… I can walk by myself… Mizura! See, didn’t I tell you?! I’m okay by myself! Mother… Father! Mother! Father! Do not cry… Sumaru… Your parents protected the star\Nand protected the village admirably. Sumaru… Look up at the sky and watch. There is a treasure you can see only\Nin the Village Hidden in the Stars. If you were born as a Shinobi, for the sake of protecting this village,\Nfor the sake of protecting the star, become strong! Like your father and your mother… Okay? Lord…Hoshikage… Yeah, this looks good! Naruto… Huh? At this rate, Mizura will die! I felt a Chakra disturbance\Nand looked into it. Despite him lying quietly, his Chakra was being activated\Nto the utmost limit. If that keeps up, he’ll be killed\Nby his own Chakra. That could never be…! There’s no mistake… But…! It’s because of the star training. The star has the power\Nto activate Chakra. However, many Shinobi are unable\Nto control the amplification, their bodies break down\Nand it leads to death. In the middle of this training,\NMizura also… The Third Hoshikage terminated\Ntraining utilizing the star due to the large amount of casualties. Then why again? Lord Akahoshi,\Nthe current leader of the village, decided to resume the training\Nhalf a year ago. Something so dangerous! We’ll make him stop right now! Those born and raised in this village\Ndo not fear the star training! Why would you…? If they can complete the training\Nby themselves and make every effort possible for\Nthe village as a Hidden Star Shinobi… Even if the body were to be destroyed,\Nthey would be satisfied. That’s just… Go! Notice my Chakra… Natsuhi! Hotarubi… Please protect the star,\Nprotect Sumaru… Akahoshi’s Chakra… Please use this until you get better…\NI’m sure you will! Thanks, Naruto… But I won’t… It seems his condition has stabilized… Everyone seems okay for the time being. It still doesn’t sit right with me… Mizura and Hokuto, they’re all thinking\Nearnestly of the village. Especially that Sumaru guy. He thinks of the village\Nmore than anyone. What do you mean…? If it were for the sake\Nof protecting the village and the special comrades around me… I would’ve gotten impatient,\Nwanting to get strong quickly as well. Yeah… That’s right… Yes… Well, this isn’t the time to\Nbe saying stuff like that. The unforgivable one is that star thief! But, there wouldn’t be any suffering\Nfrom training if they didn’t use the star. I think so, too. If they have the star, everyone would train\Nfor the sake of the village. But if they do train,\Nthen their bodies get… Geez, I don’t know what to do! Our mission is to protect the star.\NOur first priority is to get back the star. We shouldn’t be meddling in\Nthe matters that follow! That’s right… Okay. Got it! Lee and Tenten, you guys search\Naround the village chief once more! What? Again? Why did the flying Shinobi escape\Nto the dangerous Valley of Death? Even though he got the star, why did he go so far as\Nto take Sumaru away? Come to think of it… Why is that? The quality of Chakra of\Nthe one who took the star and the one who took Sumaru away\Nwere completely different. – Huh?! 					– What?! Say what?! That’s right…\NThere are two masked Shinobi! What does that mean? In my opinion, there’s more to\Nthis mission than meets the eye. As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku,\NLady Natsuhi. Where is he…? Where’s Sumaru?! Before that, I’ll have you return\Nthe star to me… I’ll trade it for Sumaru! The star first! I refuse! Then I’ll take it back by force\Nif I have to! What’s so funny?! Akahoshi…\NYou’re no competition to me. Even after you left the village, a few of us who were interested\Ncontinued training in secret! You think you have completed\Nthe star training by training on your own? Verify with your own eyes whether\Nor not I’m no competition! Ninja Art: Kujaku! Beast! Such a folly… I have no choice. Ninja Art: Kujaku… Beast! Wha--?! To think she’d be this tough… Yotaka! Shisou! Go! – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir! What’re you thinking, Akahoshi?! I’ll have you play along with me\Na little while longer…Lady Natsuhi. Huh? What is it? A flow of massive Chakra… Is it him?! No mistake! Oh?! Who is it?! Our helper from the Leaf… The Shinobi who seized the star\Nhas appeared! Lord Akahoshi is now delaying\Nthat person… Please fight with us! All right! Let’s hurry! The enemy’s power is mighty\Nand Lord Akahoshi alone cannot… It’s all he can do to delay the enemy. Right. Leave it to us! It seems nobody’s here. It seems they’ve gone out… There’s a faint presence\Ninside the residence. Now’s our chance. Let’s infiltrate! Right! Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu! What?! Lee? Since when could you use Ninjutsu…? Tenten! It’s okay. There’s nobody in here! Hey, that’s not Ninjutsu! Kind of… Suspicious, eh? Yikes! Uh…uh, oh… Well… I guess I can do it later. It seems to be a medical room… Somebody’s being laid down in a bed. I wonder who it is? That’s…! Sumaru! Why did you make Sumaru and\Nthe others do that star training? You should’ve been told by\Nthe Third Hoshikage about how dangerous that training is! You yourself…are the answer to that! What?! That Chakra is wonderful! It would make for great fighting strength if we had one hundred, no,\Neven ten Shinobi like you! The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages\Nwould be no match for us even if they all ganged up on us! It’s still not too late. Let’s make this village into\Nan invincible Hidden Star Village! It hurts… It hurts… My body feels like it is on fire! Help me… I must train… Star training… – That’s enough… That’s enough.\N– For the sake of Hidden Star Village… There’s no need to do\Nsuch painful training! That sorrow must not be repeated… If you’re saying you’re going to\Ncontinue this any further…! W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die! You can’t do it! Natsuhi! Sumaru, who is more important\Nthan your life, is in my hands! There he is!\NHe’s moving in on Akahoshi! All right!\NI won’t let him get away this time. Wait! He’s not an opponent\Nyou can take on from the front. I’ve got a plan. A plan…? I’ll stop his Chakra,\Nso I leave the rest to you! Indeed, the situation will get worse\Nif we’re too slow. Got it! Be careful, Naruto! All right! Let’s go! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! – Let’s go! 					– Let’s go! You again?! It’s more than I imagined. It’s impossible from the front, after all. What?! Where’s the real body?! Oh, no! I get it. When controlling massive Chakra, less attention is paid to the area around\Nthe main body in spite of everything… Good thinking, Naruto! He… He did it… A woman…?! The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it… I can find the star if I take the time… But now’s my only chance\Nto defeat Natsuhi! As long as she interferes, I won’t be able\Nto carry out my ambitions! Ninja Art: Kujaku! Beast! Naruto! Look out! Shoot! Naruto! Something the matter, Mizura…? No… It’s nothing… Naruto… Mother… Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone. In a strange park,\NI play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm. Yellow Moon.

You’re the type who was yelled at\Nat the academy for not having concentration, right? That doesn’t have anything\Nto do with me now. Look at this paper. Uh? I’ve seen it. Fine, then. Look at it again. Hmm? So what is this? It’s not something that\NI need to explain in length, but when you first looked\Nat this blank piece of paper, you just glanced at\Nthe whole thing, correct?

Here, thank you for waiting. Dang it! Thank you for your patronage. What? Two bills? This is…? Oh, that kid who was here left,\Nsaying that you guys would pay. That guy!\NHow dare he make fools of us! The sound of footsteps is far off…\NHe has considerable speed! He made us look like idiots! I can’t stay quiet.\NWe have to chase him! Missus, thank you very much.\NI’ll leave the money here. Thanks! All the customers today\Nseem to be in such a hurry. He has incredible speed.\NHe must have trained very hard. Who is he? Doesn’t matter, we’re definitely\Ngoing to catch up to him! Stupid Ninja! There’s no way\Nthey can catch up to me! Owww! Darn it… Swift Runner Idate\Nmakes a mistake of a lifetime! Serves you right! You have some nerve,\Ntrying to run away from us. I’m so sorry! Huh? I’m sorry… I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss,\Nthen you guys showed up. So I did that… You kinda feel sorry\Nafter hearing his story. Then you should have said that\Nfrom the start! Ow! Huh…? What’s this? Don’t touch it! This is mine! Wh-What the…?! On your mark. Get set… Go! Weights? Try to catch me now, you idiots! Hey! He escaped again! That guy! He simply doesn’t get it! Is he for real? What a speed…! No way!\NEven we can’t catch up to him…? That’s it. We don't have a chance\Nof catching up. Dang it! He'll get it\Nwhen I see him next time! All of you, thanks for coming. Begging your pardon!\NBegging your pardon! I was born and raised\Nin the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire. I was bathed in birth water\Nat “Ichiraku Ramen.” My given name is Naruto\Nand the surname is Uzumaki. People call me-- Loser! Loser…? Nah, not that! You’re funny as usual. Boss Jirocho,\Nyou're looking good yourself. Hey, Naruto! That's okay.\NA boy should be this spunky. The greetings seem to be done,\Nso I’ll get to the main topic. The Fifth Hokage told us to get\Nthe details of this mission from you. Yes, in fact… Do you know of the Dedication Ceremony\Nat the Todoroki Great Shrine? To…Todo…what? Well, make yourselves comfortable. The legend goes… A long time ago,\Nin order to subdue a storm, Ryuko’s Jewels were dedicated\Nto the Todoroki Great Shrine and the storm subsided. It became a customary event\Nthat happens once every four years. At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels,\Nbut several decades ago, it became a festival in which\Nthe first-place runner became the man of the year. In recent years, the festival has\Ntaken on another face. For ages now,\Nin this port town of Degarashi, two families,\Nthe Wasabi and the Wagarashi, have controlled local operations\Nand policed the town. It’s embarrassing, but conflict between the two families\Nhas never ceased and there have been numerous skirmishes\Nover territorial rights. As the struggle intensified, the town residents became entangled\Nand even got injured… In order to put a stop to the conflict,\Nfor the first time, there was talk of some kind of mediation\Nin the presence of the lord. And it was agreed that the power holder\Nof the town would be determined in a contest\Nrather than through brawls. So that contest is… It is the Todoroki Great Shrine\NDedication Ceremony that is held every four years. Four years ago, the Wagarashi\Neasily won by hiring a Shinobi, and we have learned that\Nthey've hired a Shinobi again this year. In order to counteract that, we sent messengers to\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village with a request, but they were ambushed and attacked. I beg you guys! Please lend us your power. We cannot afford to lose this race\Nto the Wagarashi Family! Leave it to me! And, who do you want us\Nto escort? Oh, so you’ll take this job? Did you call for me, Boss? Oh, you guys know each other?\NThen that makes the story fast. That might not actually\Nbe the case… Boss Jirocho is an important person! By rights, he shouldn’t bow\Nhis head to Ninja like you! Even if he did bow his head,\NI’d flatly refuse to escort a guy like you. Oh yeah?! As if I’d go with some guy who came\Nfrom who-knows-where! ""Some guy from who-knows-where""?! I am the brilliant Ninja,\NNaruto Uzumaki, who will eventually inherit\Nthe name of Hokage! Hah! Hokage is no big deal! Hah! The boss of hooligans\Nis even less of a big deal! You idiot! Boss Jirocho is\Na very honorable person! The Hokage is a great Shinobi who puts his life on the line\Nto protect the village! Boss Jirocho is a very,\Nvery, very honorable person who always puts his life\Non the line to protect the town! Hokage is more, more,\Nmore incredible! Even though it’s a tourist resort,\Neverything seems so expensive. Sorry about that.\Nlt sure is expensive, isn't it? Oh no, I didn’t mean… We actually don’t want to sell\Nat this kind of price, but after the Wagarashi family\Ncame into power… P-Please forgive me! How dare you?! Do you know who you have\Nto thank to do business? Are you actually thinking about turning\Nagainst the Wagarashi Family? N-Not at all.\NBut I have to get paid… You’re slow to understand. – Hey! 					– Yes, sir! P-Please stop! Huh! First of all, we’ll destroy you… Wh-Who are you?! Get out of here before you get hurt! – What?! 					– What?! Please run away! These people are from\Nthe Wagarashi… It’ll be fine. – You punk! 					– Wise guy! We’ll let you go for today! If you’ve learned your lesson,\Nnever defy us again, kid! Or you’ll pay when\Nwe see you next time! – Y-You won’t get away with this!\N– Y-You won’t get away with this! Young man… Thank you very much. What a refreshing feeling! We definitely need Boss Jirocho's\NWasabi Family to win the upcoming race. Sasuke… Yeah… Boss… Of all people,\Ndid you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi? Don’t sulk like that, Idate. I'm not sulking. It’s just that… Idate… I believe in you more\Nthan anybody else. The rest depends on you. Why don’t you believe\Nin people a little? Idate… please run for this town. I beg you! Boss… Okay. Even in exchange for my life… Wow, I didn’t think it was going\Nto be this big! But what kind of race is it? I’ll explain the course so\Na dummy like you can understand. The starting point is Degarashi Port. After the start, you head for\NModoroki Shrine which is the midway point. This is Modoroki Shrine…? Yes… It seems the fastest way\Nto get to Modoroki Shrine is to use a boat from here. Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewels\Nfrom Modoroki Shrine and dedicate that jewel at the\NTodoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island. That's the only rule\Nfor the race. So shortcuts, obstructions,\Nand secret maneuvers are all allowed. So hiring a Ninja is not\Na violation of the rule either. Who are the Ninja that\Nthe other side hired? They’re hiding somewhere\Nand checking the situation. Don’t be careless, Naruto! R-Right! You guys can just relax and watch.\NDon’t follow me around! What?! I’m saying I don’t want\Nan impediment. You! Calm down.\NLet’s join forces here. – Not with a guy like this!\N– Not with a guy like this! They seem to strangely be\Nin harmony, these two. All right, everybody! The Todoroki Great Shrine Race\Nwill start soon! Wasabi Family's runner,\Nldate Morino! Idate…Morino? Wagarashi Family’s runner,\NFukusuke Hikyakuya! On your mark! Start! All right! We’re going too! Wh-What the--?! Is he running away?! Where are you going, Idate?! Hey, wait! Wh-What is he doing…? Wait! I believe your promise,\Nits a true heart give me courage Always I feel it\Nthe precious time with you On your still shoulder I feel the wind that blows\Ntowards tomorrow The city lights are like pieces of stars That hold us together “Each one of us glows differently,” you say laughingly but you look most dazzling Like a comet, like the rainbow after the storm You bring light into my heart Being lost can be the answer Let’s promise we won’t cheat Uh... like a shooting star,\Nwe do go ahead. What the heck is he thinking?!\NThat idiot! So fast. He's moving at\Nan incredible speed. Darn it! The opponent's already\Nfar out at sea! This is bad! If the distance between them gets\Nany greater, it'll be impossible to win! That idiot! – Kick it up a notch, Sakura!\N– Right! We're gonna bring him back at all cost\Nand make up the difference!

A hot spring? Yeah, just off of this road\Nthere’s a nice town with a hot spring. Yunosato Hot Springs… They say it does a world of good\Nfor fatigue and beauty. Aren’t we going straight home?\NEveryone’s waiting! Naruto’s right. Our hometown is in\Na state of emergency, there’s no time to procrastinate. It won't make much difference\Nif we’re one or two days late… It’s really popular with girls,\Nand it’s mixed bathing… Hey?! Pervy Sage? Sometimes it’s necessary for humans\Nto take breathers. We’ll take one bath! That’s not what you said before! It’s okay. Well, let’s go! That’s her, no mistake. We’ve finally…found her. Kidnapped!\NNaruto’s Hot Spring Adventure! We have the pleasure of\Na visit from four people and one piglet. – Welcome! 					– Welcome! Even though this has mixed bathing… I’m all alone with this brat.\NI’m so unlucky. Well then, shall we play pachinko\Nor something? We have plenty of time before dinner. You’re not going to the hot spring? If we go right now, there are fools… So, let’s go, let’s go. I’m going to get out already. Not yet, not yet.\NNot until the girls get here. Oh, I see… Well, c’mon girls.\NAll of you, come on… Welcome! Ah, that was refreshing. W-We've been robbed! The necklace I got from\NOld Lady Tsunade is gone! Where! Where is it?! ""If you want your necklace back,\Ngive back the money""? ""Will wait at the three cedars on\Nthe mountain behind."" Signed, the Akagi Family. Money? What are they talking about? Girls came in, all right. But… they’re all female monkeys! I want to bathe with people. Hey, here I am! Come out! Akagi Family! What do you want, kid?! That’s my line! I haven’t borrowed any money\Nfrom you people! So give me my necklace back! “My” necklace? Did we mistake his stuff\Nfor that woman's? Ah, that’s it!\NGive it back! W-Wait! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Go! You thieves! – Take this! 					– Go! H-Help… People came, all right… But… They’re all men! – Bring it on! 					– Cheers! I want to bathe with women… Huh? So the one who borrowed money\Nis Old Lady Tsunade? Yes…nicknamed\N“the Legendary Sitting Duck.” She played at the Akagi gambling den\Nuntil she was penniless. We loaned her what she lost. That’s right, and there’s an I.O.U. Wha--?! There are so many zeros! I’m Senta, this guy is called Bunzo. The boss ordered us to collect\Non the debt three years ago… We set out on a journey\Nfrom Akagi Mountain prepared not to return\Nuntil we get the money back. We’ve heard rumors about\Nthe lady here and there… But, she sure was something. She was elusive and quite hard to find. Then recently, we caught\Nsome information that she’d appeared. We were waiting on\Nthe side of the road… That’s when we came along\Nwith Old Lady Tsunade. But why did you raid the room\Nso stealthily? Rumor has it that that ordinary means don't work\Nagainst the “Legendary Sitting Duck.” We didn’t think that\Nif we tried to collect amicably, she would pay us. She’s certainly stingy… We heard that she cherished the necklace\Nnext to her life, so we thought she’d pay\Nin exchange for it. No way. After all, you raided my room. We never even dreamed that the owner\Nof the necklace would have changed… Err… Can’t you ask the lady to pay? Uh, even you say so... Please! If we don’t get the money back,\Nwe can’t go home! Our wives and kids are waiting for us\Nto come home! – Please…I’m begging you!\N– Please…I’m begging you! It’s all gone… Bad luck…\NDarn it. I’m stone broke. Well, let’s call it quits with pachinko. It’s about time for a bath… – Shizune… 					– Yes? My bag is at the front desk of the inn. What?!\NY-You can’t mean to bring it here?! Everything to your name is in it… I’ve just lost! I can’t repress this feeling! Just bring it without complaint. Yes, ma'am! Huh? Could you be… Y-You are…! There are women, all right… But… I was hoping for younger,\Nmore titillating women… This one, right? Thank you… Are you with Ms. Tsunade? Yes. This came for her not long ago… To Tsunade\N		A letter? I wonder who could’ve…? Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Huh? Lady Tsunade! She’s not here… Okay, Tonton… You know to search for\NLady Tsunade, right! What, impossible? Why? I see! The smell of the sulfur\Nfrom the hot spring interferes… Well then, the only way\Nto search for her is on foot! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade! Where are you! We have a problem! Lady Tsunade! Oh, what in the world should I do? We have Naruto Uzumaki. If you want him returned unharmed,\Nplease return all of the money you owe! We'll wait by the three cedars on\Nthe mountain behind. The Akagi Family What should I do?\NI have to help Naruto. On top of that, if it’s discovered\Nthat Lady Tsunade has a huge debt, talk of her installment as\Nthe Fifth Hokage will probably end. That’s right, we have\Nto handle this by ourselves. Right, Tonton? Do you think it’s going to work out well? No problem. Here she comes. Old Lady Tsunade! Stop! You know who we are, right? You’re the henchmen of the Akagi. Then I'll make it brief. Pay back your debt\Nin one lump sum. Or else… his life is over! Help me! Whatever.\NHis life doesn’t matter much to me. – Huh!\N– What did you just say?! Well then, the money… Why did it come to this? This isn’t titillating,\Nthis is just tight! Drats! Let me have patience! Didn’t you hear me? It doesn’t matter to me\Nwhat happens with his life. You… darn old hag! Was what I would have said,\Nuntil just a little bit ago, I think. Once I become the Hokage,\Nhe’d be a precious subordinate. I can’t leave him in the mess. Old Lady Tsunade… Right now, this is all I’ve got.\NTake it. Let me make sure of this. I don’t mean it’s paid off in full,\Nbut that’ll do it for the interest, right? Fake! You’re not going to pay\Nthe money back? It's none of your business. These guys can’t go home!\NDon’t you feel sorry for them! You couldn’t possibly? In that case, I’ll have to use force\Nto get it back! Naruto’s Shadow Clones?! I see, Naruto has joined hands\Nwith the Akagi Family… So, where did Naruto and company go? As expected… I didn’t think she’d hand\Nthe money over meekly. But to be that much of a coward… What should we do? Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase. No doubt there’s money in it. We have to do something\Nto get our hands on that suitcase. Shoot! I'm supposed to be kidnapped,\Nand she’s casually drinking sake. It’s that suitcase. How do we get it out? Leave it to me. Lady Tsunade, you’ve returned. Ah, here’s the suitcase. It’s dangerous,\Nso let’s leave it at the front desk. Well then… Look, I went and got it! – You did it! 					– You did it! Old Lady Tsunade! Shoot… If you’re the Hokage… If you’re the Hokage, then pay your debt back\Nlike a Hokage would! A Hokage is meant\Nto protect everyone! These guys can’t return their home,\Nthey are desperate! Why don’t you do something?! Naruto… Or do people from other countries\Nnot matter to you? That kind of Hokage…\NI cannot accept! Now! Here! Hurry up and run away! – Right! 					– Okay! Oh, she’s already catching up! It’s all or nothing! Huh? – You did it! 					– You did it! Tonton?! Naruto! Just hand over the suitcase! Or else! F-Fork over the suitcase! If we take a direct hit from\NOld Lady Tsunade’s attack, then it’s over! Out of the way, out of the way! Purse snatchers? Excuse us! Hey what’s going on?! Hey! Don’t cause trouble\Nfor the general public! It’s because you’re following us! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What’s going on…? Naruto, we leave it up to you. This is no good. If the contents of that suitcase\Nbecome known, it will be a disaster… That’s right, that happened too. And I was young then too. Gulp it down. Excuse me, Boss. What is it? You’re in front of a guest. W-Well… A clone! That’s a clone too? Wrong again. Sheesh, which is the real one?! The rest… – Where are the rest?!\N– Where are the rest?! Over there! – Hold it! 					– Hold it! – Naruto! 					– Naruto! – Wait! 					– Wait! – Naruto! 					– Naruto! Prepare yourself! Shoot, let me go! Let me go! Settle down! G-Got it! The money! Okay, they got it! IOU’s?! It’s not money?! – Oh no…\N– This is too much! What are you doing?!\NThis is in the middle of town! Huh! T-Two Old Ladies?! You’re mixed up in\Nthis commotion as well? I’d like to hear your reason\Nfor it, Shizune! Hello… Lady Tsunade… What?! Shizune… And you guys belong to the Akagi. B-Boss Jirocho! Who? You don’t know?! He’s the number one gang boss,\NJirocho from the Land of Tea! He’s an old friend of mine. As luck would have it,\Nwe met by accident on the street. You’re Bunzo and Senta\Nif I’m not mistaken. Just in time.\NI have something to say to you! – What?! 					 – What?! You mean the debt to the Akagi Family? I paid it back a year ago. Is that true? That was last year,\Nwhen we were near Akagi’s. Did you forget? I-I’m sorry. Hey! It’s a circular from Akagi\Naddressed to me. I’ll just read the part addressed to you. “Senta and Bunzo, “The debt is paid, come home soon.”\NSigned, Shugoro Akagi. See? You've gotta be kidding. All that energy spent, for nothing. – Thank you for helping us.\N– Thank you for helping us. – Now we can go home relieved.\N– Now we can go home relieved. Go in good spirits. – You too, Naruto. Take care!\N– You too, Naruto. Take care! Hey, if the suitcase\Ndoesn’t have money in it, why were you so serious\Nabout getting it back? That’s… If the IOU’s were discovered\Nby the people in the village, they’ll oppose Lady Tsunade’s\Ninstallment as Hokage. You worry too much. The Hokage and the debt\Nare unrelated. Not only that,\Nshe said she returned the money, so there’s nothing to worry about. At least the Akagi debt was… What? Don’t worry, don’t worry! What? We forgot something? Finally, the time has come. Communal bathing with girls… Patience paid off… I believe your promise,\Nits a true heart give me courage Always I feel it\Nthe precious time with you On your still shoulder I feel the wind that blows\Ntowards tomorrow The city lights are like pieces of stars That hold us together “Each one of us glows differently,” you say laughingly but you look most dazzling Like a comet, like the rainbow after the storm You bring light into my heart Being lost can be the answer Let’s promise we won’t cheat Uh... like a shooting star,\Nwe do go ahead. You're awesome,\NOld Lady Tsunade! Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke\Nare all right now! You can't rejoice yet. The current situation\Nin the village is serious. You're right.\NI have to do my best, And work hard for\Nthe village as well. Hey! N-Naruto,\Nwhere do you think you're going?! I have to fill my stomach first!

162,"I want to try and gather\Nthe unrestrained winds I’ll run toward the horizon,\Nalongside the wave crests I’ve made my decision, even if there’s a long way to go\Non that road. I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? What is it? Who are you?! It was you…?\NYou killed him, didn’t you? N-No… I don’t know anything…! The Cursed Warrior…? The Cursed Warrior Old man’s…snot! I just can’t get myself into\Ntraining doing it alone… I wonder if we won’t get a mission\Nconnected to Sasuke or something. The Land of Birds?\NFrom such a remote land… That’s what’s troubling us. The “Cursed Warrior” apparition has been\Ndisturbing the castle town and misleading the public, huh? So they want us to exterminate a ghost? I declined once saying\Nwe can’t go so far as to accept the extermination\Nof a ghost, but… I must have you accept this at any cost.\NPlease accept! Is it because the money isn’t enough? We in the Land of Birds are\Nexperiencing financial difficulties. Even this is the very limit\Nthe budget will allow… It’s not an issue of money. In other words,\Nit’s the mission details. Be that as it may, indeed there isn’t even enough to\Ncover travel expenses with this amount… Now that things have come\Nto this pass… I shall commit harakiri…! Don’t be hasty! Yikes! It’s the little bit of pocket money\NI have saved up. I’ll pay out of my own pocket.\NSo with this, please…! And that’s why you accepted it? It’s indulgent even for me… Nonetheless, most of the\NJonin and Chunin are out on missions. I was thinking of how to handle this… I guess someone’s talking about you. Everyone’s busy with missions,\Nso they don’t have time for such things. Who’s that guy…? He’s been like that since earlier. Even tasty ramen won’t go down the throat\Nright being watched like that! Come inside and eat if you’re hungry! No, I’m not hungry… So? Tasty, huh? Yes! Thanks for your business. Come back and have Naruto\Ntreat you again… Again and again like that?\NGive me a break. Thank you for treating me.\Nln appreciation… N-No, you don’t need to worry about it… But hey, what’s your name? You’re not a familiar face\Nfrom this village… Yes, my name is Chishima and\NI have come from the Land of Birds. I came to the Village Hidden in\Nthe Leaves to commission a mission… You’re flat broke even though\Nyou came as a messenger of your land? There wasn’t enough money\Nfor the commission, so I even used up\Nmy own pocket money… Then it must be\Na very important mission, huh? It might even cost an important friend\Nof mine’s very life… Your friend…?\NWhat the heck do you mean? Ever since I was little, I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi,\Nthe feudal lord of the Land of Birds… You’re friends with a feudal lord?! I said feudal lord, but he was only just appointed last year\Nand actually he’s the same age as me. No kidding?\NThen he’s a totally young feudal lord. Y-Yes… The previous feudal lord,\Nhis father Lord Owashi died from illness and after that he even lost his twin sister… Ever since then, Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful,\Nhas become a totally different person… He wouldn’t show his face\Neven if I visited… I’m worried about him as\Na friend rather than a feudal lord. I was thinking something might\Nhave happened to him… So if there is something\NI can do, I want to do whatever I can,\Nas a friend… I couldn’t…save Sasuke.\NBut this guy’s still… Leave it to me. What? Let’s save your friend! Right! Old Lady Tsunade! You’re mean! Listen, you could at least knock\Nwhen entering my office. More importantly! What do you mean\Nby fleecing bro of his pocket money and then not accepting the mission?! Huh? People call stuff like that devilish!\NYou old lady devil! Try saying that again! I’m sorry! I wonder if Naruto…is okay… He’ll be fine. You’ve gotten to know a good guy… He may not look it,\Nbut he’s quite dependable. What?! R-Right… Who said I wouldn’t accept the mission? Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji\Nto finish his mission and come back. Half-cocked jerk. Lee is on a mission with Guy. You and Tenten will form a three-man team\Nwith Neji as the leader, got it? Then did you hear from that kid\Nabout the mission details? Well actually, not yet… It’s the extermination of a ghost. A ghost? It seems that it appears when\Nyou’re walking through town at night… A ghost clad in white armor. That’s what you’ll… I-I didn’t hear anything about a ghost… Are you scared of it? I’m not scared. I couldn’t be a Ninja\Nif I got scared at stuff like that! But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts? Who knows…? Try testing it out yourself. Jeez, why didn’t you say at the start that it was a commission\Nto exterminate a ghost?! I didn’t tell you? Not even a word.\NBut that’s just a rumor anyway, right? I haven’t seen it, but… See? But it seems my master,\NLord Moso, saw it close up. F-For real?! The Land of Birds, huh…?\NThat’s sure far… Village Hidden in the Leaves Land of Birds Umm, is there more…? You sure eat a lot considering\Nyou’re thin. I’m sorry. I’m often called\Na skinny voracious eater. Hey, by the way, is there really such\Na thing as the Cursed Warrior? There are people who say it’s the disembodied spirit of\Nthe previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi. The disembodied spirit of\Na dead feudal lord… Rather than ghosts, tell us a little more about\Nthe Land of Birds. Sure… The capitol of the Land of Birds\Nstretches across the banks of the lake where migratory birds rest… It was a peaceful town with\Nlots of green and where water from the lake would\Nbe drawn into the canals… However, after the sudden death of\Nthe previous feudal lord, there was much uproar. His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei,\Nthe tactician from previously, were nominated to be\Nthe next feudal lord… But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi\Nwas still too young and was vehemently opposed\Nto him assuming the feudal lordship. But in the end, Lord Sagi\Ntook the seat of feudal lord and the matter was closed\Nwith Moso the high priest providing tutelage as\Na superintendent official… However, before even half\Na year passed, Lady Toki, his twin sister,\Ndied suddenly… After that, Lord Sagi\Nwho was so cheerful turned into a totally different person,\Nbecame coldhearted and he now conducts governmental\Nmatters confined in his mansion… From about that time, the “Cursed Warrior” began appearing\Nin the castle town… Those in the castle town say\Nthat Lord Owashi was killed by someone… There are even those who say\Nthat the Cursed Warrior is the ghost of Lord Owashi\Nsearching for the person who drove him to death and is attempting\Nto have his revenge… That’s scary… There’s no such thing as ghosts. But… That priest Moso is the one who gained the most\Nfrom Owashi’s death, huh…? Lord Moso is a magnificent person\Nof virtue with no self-interests! Then the suspicious one is… The only one left is Komei the tactician! I bet he assassinated Owashi in an attempt to become\Nthe feudal lord, but failed! He has complained whenever\Nopportunity offered itself, after Lord Sagi became\Nthe feudal lord as well! A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi\Nby starting the rumor about the Cursed Warrior might be\Na piece of cake for Lord Komei…! All right! There’s no doubt. It’s settled.

The Deal is Off! Come! Orochimaru! Come to think of it, we’ve never gone at it\Neven once until now. That’s right! What’re you saying? I’m the one who has\Nto go at it with her, right? Now I’m going to kill\Nyou two worthless punks…here! Incredible strength as usual… It’ll be over if you’re hit once. I can see that… It’s a bit cramped here\Nfor fighting at a distance. Are you going to change the location? That would probably be better… There was another troublesome person\Nwith the Lady Tsunade’s attendant. That person may come\Nto her aid. You’re going down! Who is…the troublesome person? One of Sannin,\Nthe same as you and Lady Tsunade… Jiraiya! I won’t let you get away,\Nno matter what! Wh-What’s this?! Huh… Princess Tsunade tore it up…\Nbig time. This means that Lady Tsunade refused… Where did old Tsunade go? That belongs to Lady Tsunade…! Tonton… Which way? Okay! It looks like you’re quite\Nout of breath, too… Tsunade. It’s just about time. I’m not that great at Taijutsu, but… A Food Pill! That Sign…! This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu… He got my muscle…! I severed, ever so slightly, the bicep muscle of your upper arm\Nand the rectus muscle of your thigh. Now you won’t be able to release\Nyour incredible strength. A Chakra scalpel, eh…\NWhy don’t you target the arteries? Indeed, with this scalpel, I could cut the muscles and vessels\Nwithout external injury. But as may be expected, I can’t make a long, delicate scalpel\Nin the middle of battle that can reach the arteries\Nand the heart muscle. But, even so… there’d be no problem at all\Nif I target the opponent’s neck! Dang it! My intercostals got hit.\NMy breathing… He’s no ordinary Medical Ninja. His Jutsu sense and his edge\Nexceed even me in my heyday! It would still be trouble\Nif you were to die on me. I won’t target your vital spot… But with this, you can’t move anymore… She’s amazing… Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able\Nto budge due to difficulty breathing. It looks like it will be necessary\Nto rough her up a little more… but not enough to kill her. Even though I’m trying to move my hand… my leg moves?! D-Don’t tell me! This is… You little! In my present condition, this seems to be the extent of my power… I see… It’s… It’s not the muscles…\Nlt’s the nerves! It seems you’ve realized…\NThat’s right. It’s the nerves!

The communication between\Nthe brain and the body is all done with electric signals… Tsunade jumbled up all of\Nthe electric signals that are exchanged at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour. Having left battle and yet such power… So this is the legendary Sannin? Healing-types use too much Chakra… But in this condition… If I try to move my right hand… my left leg moves. If I try to move my left ankle… my right shoulder moves. It’s difficult… But I’ve already grasped eighty percent\Nof what moves when I move what. Don’t mess with me… with this low-level… Jutsu! What?! In only a moment,\Nhis body movements… You’re scared of blood, aren’t you?! I’ll show you plenty from now! Jiraiya…? It’s been a long time… Jiraiya.

Hey… I’ll take… these guys! Just because you’ve mastered\Nyour body movements… it doesn’t mean… you can move like normal! I won’t let you get away now! Too late!

What’s happening?! Why’s Kabuto fighting\Nwith old Tsunade?! You’re slow, Naruto… That’s why you’re no match for Sasuke. Take a good look at the headband! He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate. Wha--?! That’s right… I was a spy from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Sound. Wh-What’re you saying? You’re lying, right, Kabuto? During the Chunin Exam\Nyou taught us a lot… And you also saved us. Well, I wanted to gather data\Non you guys. Naruto, there’s something\NI understood by gathering your data. You have no Ninja ability. Unlike Sasuke! It’s the first time\NI’ve seen Lady Tsunade like this… Please don’t push it too far alone. I’m your attendant, so… Old Lady Tsunade… Even with a fierce look, you’re just a cute Genin\Nwho’s a fish out of water. Admittedly, I was anticipating\Nthe monster dwelling inside you… But now,\Nwith the legendary Sannin before me, you leave something to be desired. You’re just a puny zero.\NSo if you meddle… I’ll kill you. You little! Don’t, Naruto! My body’s still… That hand… He shouldn’t be able to use\Nthat right hand anymore. Shadow Clone Jutsu! I’ll attack at once with four… and break him from the right side\Nwhere he can’t defend! You little! Okay! What? Blood? Poison Needles! My neural reflexes still haven’t\Ncompletely returned! I can’t dodge completely! With the headband…! Good job, acting so quickly… Thanks, Shizune! That’s… A Plasma Pill! A Plasma Pill? So he’s trying to replenish\Nlost blood, huh… That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me… The blood is gushing out nicely,\Neh, Kabuto? Lord Orochimaru… Please take off the bandage\Non your left arm. That man is Orochimaru… At last, the real thing appears… Shizune! Y-Yes! You take care of…\Nthat guy with the glasses! I’ll take care of Orochimaru!

I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? I guess the storm is\Ngoing to come soon… Let’s hurry and head back\Nto the curry shop. Oh my. That thunder right now… came from the direction\Nof the Katabami Gold Mine… Raiga's Counterattack B-Boss. R-Ranmaru! Hey, wake up, Ranmaru! Quit joking around.\NI’m not laughing… Hey…Ranmaru…! You… What did you do\Nto Ranmaru? N-No! He… When Ranmaru held your hand… you revived and… And then…Ranmaru… Ranmaru… Why is Raiga up?! I must stop him. Thunder? Could it be?! You’re slow! Are you…that brat’s comrade…? If it’s a wooden weapon, then… But I can’t hold it over my head… You’re annoying! You little fly…! Quit buzzing! I’m…not smart, you know… Huh…? I don’t know why this happened… Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?! N-No! That’s not true! Perhaps…the guys from the Leaf… Oh yeah…\Nlf they didn’t come, then Ranmaru and I would\Nhave been together forever… Where are they?! You know, don’t you?!\Nlf you don’t know, I’ll kill you! I know… Maybe…! Take me…where they are… Go! Yes! Hold on, Ranmaru.\NFor your funeral… I’ll offer up their corpses for you. Ranmaru… This child… Did he give up his life\Nin order to revive Raiga? Rai…ga… Rai… Ranmaru! You're alive! Hang in there! Ranmaru! Ranmaru! It started raining. But we’re almost done. Oh my, I’m happy that\Nyou all did this much for me. Oh no! Mom! Something horrible happened! Oh my… What happened, Karashi? Tenten is…! What happened to Tenten? She…fell from a cliff and.. What?! What do you mean?! I was running with her and Tenten said that she would train me\Nin place of Lee… But there…when we were\Napproaching the Lightning Pass, the lightning struck and\Na tree came falling and Tenten fell from the Pass\Nto the bottom of the cliff! Oh my! Then you must go\Nhelp her out immediately! Let’s go to help, Tenten! Yeah! Umm… No, I will… I will come after you guys\Nwith the first-aid kit. Okay. Let’s go, Naruto, Lee. – Yes! 					– Right! Oh my, Karashi? Mom, we’re running away\Nfrom here. What are you saying, child?! Never mind that! I’ll explain it later,\Nso hurry up and get ready. I will wait at the Lightning Pass. Bring them for sure. If not… I’ll offer up you and your mom’s corpses\Nto Ranmaru… Mom, please! I don’t want to! I'm going to wait\Nuntil everybody comes back! Mom! You are so stubborn! Just come with me! Do you think that Tenten would\Nfall off a cliff merely because of the thunder? Huh? What do you mean? That Karashi…\Nlt seems like he wasn’t trained enough. I’m sorry… Then… Perhaps…it’s some kind\Nof trap again. Or he’s been threatened\Nby someone… But the Kurosuki Family is…! Maybe my eyes were cloudy… No way! It’s him… He’s burning up with fever… Raiga…? He revived, so you should too… It’s all right. I’m going to die\Nsoon anyway. No way! I’m not going to let you say\Nthat you're going to die so easily! The people who were killed by you\Nand Raiga died against their will! I’m not going to let it go your way! For the sake of those\Nwhose freedoms you took away. I’m going to have you\Ntake responsibility! Are you okay? The storm… It’ll be dangerous\Nto stay here… To Grandma’s place. You’ve come! Raiga! So he is alive. This time I’ll take you down for sure! Let’s go! That’s not good! Lee! What are you…? What is this? It’s in a whole different level\Nfrom before…! Probably that attack was\Nlightning made of Chakra. But this one… Real lightning is used as the source… If he can utilize the power of nature,\Nunlike Chakra, he’ll have no limits! Get down! Byakugan! If we dodge through\Nthe electric shock and take this to a close-range battle… Naruto! I know it! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Good job, Naruto! Gentle Fist! Neji! You brats! Is that all you know? Unlike the natural thunder power\NI’m using, Chakra has its limits! Huh…? You’re an idiot!\NThere’s an idiot here! Is that what you say to an opponent\Nwho fought with all his power?! Huh? You again… This time I’m not going to\Nhave a funeral for you! I am angry. Oh my, what are you doing?! Please Mom, come with me! There’s no time. No, I’m going to stay here! Oh Tenten! Oh my! This stupid son of mine! I couldn’t help it,\Nbecause the boss came back to life… If we stay here,\Nwe’re going to get killed. The only choice we have\Nis to run away! If you want to run away,\Nthen go. I’m not running away. I’m not going to give up,\NI will save this child. I will feed this boy\Nthe curry of life! Grandma… It’s the curry that revived Lee. Yes. If anything happens,\Nit’s not my fault! You! One, two… One, two… One, two… One, two… One, two… One, two… This is bad… This is really bad! Eat this…you’ll feel better. Please. You messed up on\Nmixing the spices. Oh my?! Karashi, could you have memorized\Nmy recipe of the curry of life? Karashi… This is the true curry of life. Here, please eat this. You can’t even eat\Nif you’re not with Raiga? Why…? Why…for a person like me? Does one need a reason\Nto save someone? To save you, Grandma Sansho and Karashi\Ndid their best to make the curry. Don’t you feel anything seeing\Nthose two trying their best? If you don’t feel anything,\Nyou’re a horrible human being! Human beings support each other\Nin order to live… If there are people who need help,\Ndon’t others naturally lend them a hand? Isn’t that being human? Anyway, one bite is fine.\NWhy don’t you try it? Was it good? That is what it feels like to live. Raiga … I want him to eat this curry too. Let’s go. I’m far from finished…! This guy…\NWhat is up with him? So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here? Even I have times when\NI just don’t understand, baby When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you Even on nights when we’re apart,\NI’ll be close to you I’ll be close to you Damn it! What in the world\Nhappened to my body?! It is pitch black in front of me,\Nmy entire body is numb, and my body doesn’t do\Nwhat I want it to do. What is this feeling…?

8,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Such intensity... If I take a breath or move my eyes\NI will be marked and killed – that's what I'm feeling.. If I'm stuck like this for an hour,\NI'll go mad. Facing a Jonin intent to kill… This sensation is like having\Nmy life held in limbo... No way! I'd rather die\Nto escape this feeling! Sasuke... Don't worry. I'll protect\Nyou all with my life. I absolutely won't allow\Nmy comrades to get killed. I don't know about that... It's over. Sensei! Behind you!! Die!! The Water Clone Jutsu...? It can't be. Don't move! The Oath of Pain It's over. W-Wow!! Did you say it's over? You don't understand, do you? You won't be able to beat me\Njust by making like a monkey… No chance. But, I must say you're good. My Water Clone Jutsu was\Nbeing copied at that point… I absolutely won't allow\Nmy comrades to get killed. By letting the clone talk as if it were you,\Nyou succeeded in distracting me. And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu\Nto hide yourself to see what I was doing… But… I'm not a fool. That one was a fake too! Now! Makibishi spikes…! How foolish...! Sensei! Oh, I can't believe that\NKakashi Sensei got … kicked away like that…. His Taijutsu skills are also\Nextremely good. W-What's with this water...?\Nlt's awfully heavy. Humph... Fool! It's the Water Prison Jutsu! Darn it. My temporary escape\Ninto the water… was a huge mistake! You're caught… It's a special prison that makes\Nit impossible for you to escape! It makes things harder\Nhaving you able to act. Now…Kakashi. I'll have to settle things\Nwith you later. First, I will finish those guys off. Water Clone Jutsu… Didn't expect this level of skill… You're acting big,\Nwearing a headband like a Ninja… But…a real Ninja is one who has hovered between\Nlife and death numerous times. In other words, only those who are worth being listed\Nin my Bingo Book deserve to be called Ninja. Guys like you can't be\Ncalled real Ninja. He's disappeared again! You're just a kid! Naruto! You three! Take Tazuna and run! You have no chance\Nagainst this guy! As long as he has me trapped\Nin this Water Prison, he won't be able\Nto move from here. And he shouldn't be able to use\Nthe Water Clone Jutsu if he's far enough away\Nfrom his real body. In any case, just run for now! Run away? You've got to be kidding me. That option was gone\Nfrom the moment you got caught. Even if we ran, without you, sooner or later\Nwe'd be defeated by Zabuza… and we'd all be destroyed. Even if we were to reform\Nthe Manji defense, it would be impossible\Nto block his attacks. In the end… we'll have... no options left. In order for us to survive,\Nour only option is to rescue you. We'll just have to do it! There…! Too easy. Sasuke! Sasuke… T-This is the Jonin level…\NA real Ninja… We've got to run…\NAt this rate… Seriously…! Seriously…! We'll be killed!! I'm going to swear on\Nthe pain of my left hand! I'll never get into another situation\Nfrom which I'll have to be rescued… I'll never be afraid or\Nbe a coward. Are you hurt…scaredy cat? I won't lose to Sasuke. Can I borrow that\NLeaf headband for a while? This? This is worn only by those who have\Ngraduated from Ninja Academy. Naruto, come over here.\NI'd like to give you something. Congratulations on your graduation. That's because you're\Nall squirts who don't have the qualifications\Nto become Ninjas. Missions are all risky assignments. You pass! I'm not that little prankster\Nthat you think I am! I'm going to surpass the Hokage! And so I'm going to get\Nthe entire Village to acknowledge my existence! That's right… I am a Ninja now. And... I decided that I was not going\Nto run anymore! That I wouldn't run away…! Y-You fool! Stop it! Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?! Humph! Fool... What are you thinking…\Ncharging off on your own?! Even Sasuke is no match for him… No matter how hard we try,\Nwe Genin are no match for him… Huh...?! The headband….?! Hey! You, with no brows... Record in your Bingo Book… about the man who will one day\Nbecome the Leaf Village's Hokage. Leaf-style Ninja… Naruto Uzumaki!! Naruto… When I first saw that little kid,\Nhe seemed so unreliable… Sasuke! Lend me your ear! What is it? I have a plan. You want to discuss plans\Nunder these circumstances…? This guy...! Humph!\NYou are talking of teamwork? W-What is this feeling…? Was Naruto so…? Now... Let's get wild… Now, let's get wild! Such loud snorting,\Nbut do you have a winning plan? T-This isn't good… What are you guys doing!\NI told you to run! It was obvious what was going to happen\Nonce I was caught! Hurry! Run! Listen to me!\NOur mission is to protect Tazuna! Have you forgotten that?! Old man…. Well... This is a seed that I planted… I can't say that\NI want my life to be spared. Sorry, you guys… Fight as much as you want! You hear that? Are you ready? You guys really haven't learned\Nanything, have you? W-What?! You're still playing at being Ninja? When I was your age, this hand was already\Nstained red with blood! Zabuza, the Demon! Ohh…? It seems that\Nyou've heard of me. A long time ago, in the Mist Village,\Noften called the town of Blood Mist, Ninja candidates faced\Ntheir biggest hurdle. So you also know about\Nthat graduation exam… That graduation exam? What is it...? This graduation exam\Nthat you're talking about... The students killed each other. What….? Classmates who had shared rice\Nfrom the same pot formed pairs and tried\Nto kill each other. It didn't end\Nuntil one of them died. Partners who used to talk about\Neach other's dreams and aspirations… How cruel… Ten years ago, the Mist Village's graduation exam\Nwas forced to undergo drastic reform. That was because an evil demon\Nhad appeared on the scene the previous year. Reform? What about the reform? What had that evil demon done? With no scruples or hesitation… a young boy who didn't even have\Nthe qualifications for being a Ninja, annihilated over a hundred examinees. That sure was…fun… Sasuke! Die! Darn! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,\Nand there are quite a few of them. Here I go! It's impossible, after all… There is no way that\Nyou can defeat the guy! There is only one way left\Nto defeat this guy! Sasuke! I see! So that's your plan, Naruto! That's pretty good for you! Demon Wind Shuriken, Windmill of Shadows… A Shuriken won't work on me. I see. This time\Nit's aiming for my real body… But... It's not so easy! A Shuriken in\Nthe Shuriken's shadow...! This is...\NThe Shadow Shuriken Jutsu! A second Shuriken\Nin his blind spot! But... Still too naïve... He dodged it!! Here it is! Yes! The plan worked!! That Zabuza had no clue\Nas to what I was thinking, and I fooled him! Ninja must be able\Nto see through the obvious. Did you see that – the Leaf-style fighting\Nof Naruto Uzumaki?!

Just like the Uchiha loser earlier, why is it that each and every\NLeaf Village Ninja is an idiot? Shut up! I’m going to save those two! Are you seriously thinking\Nthey’re alive after falling off this cliff? You should’ve gotten out of here. As if… I'd abandon my comrades\Nand run away! That’s my answer to the tenth problem! What’re you saying? One more time. Eat this. Idiot. Rasengan! Naruto…! You still don’t get it?!\NYou don’t have a chance of winning! Damn! That's… the damage Sasuke inflicted. That's it!

They’re using\Nthe Water Clone Jutsu! I know! Trust us, Idate!\NWe’ll protect you, no matter what! S-Sakura… Go on ahead.\NWe’ll be right behind you. Sakura! I… I hate people who don’t know\Nwhen to quit. This is the end. A foolish cheap trick. What?! I’m saying I can’t stand this\Nsaving each other business. Idate! Your opponent is over here! Above!

We’ll cut the rope and go\Nto the opposite bank in one swing! I get it! I thought the worst of myself. But Boss Jirocho trusted in me. I trust you more than anyone. It was the first time\NI was trusted by someone. So I wanted to win this race\Nfor the boss, no matter what. But in reality, I can’t win\Njust with such feelings. So many times along the way,\NI felt like giving up. Watch out! But each time, you guys risked your lives\Nto save a lame duck like me! Naruto, I’m sorry. I should’ve trusted you guys\Nfrom the start. What’re you saying? Say stuff like that\Nafter winning the race. You’re right. Naruto! Idate! Okay, do it! Right! Boo! Boo! Boo! Now that's a rousing welcome. Naruto, at this rate,\Nwe’ll crash into the rocks! I know. Leave it to me! Release Chakra from\Nthe bottom of my feet. It’s the very last Chakra!

195,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Say, Grandma Tsunada,\Nam I really so…? Come to think of it, recently I feel dull and I make more mistakes\N with Jutsu than before. And, what’s more, even worse… I can’t eat more than five of\Nthe large-size ramen noodles at Ichiraku… Might I perhaps have\Nsome terrible illness?! Come on, and tell me.\NI’m prepared to hear the worst! You are in good health. Huh? Hey! That’s Bushy Brow’s\Nmedical record, isn’t it? Recently he’s been avoiding\Nhis regular check-ups. Bring him in, will you? Huh? But, what about me…? You are stupid. That’s all! Be on your way! – Put your clothes back on, you idiot!\N– Yes! Unbelievable! How was it? I’m fit as a fiddle! I could tell that just by looking at you. What’s that all about? He doesn’t seem to be in\Na very good mood, does he? Oh, by the way,\Nhave you seen Bushy Brow? No, but I know where he is. These days,\Nyou can always find him here. Oh… 2954… 2955… 2956… 2957… 2958… That’s just amazing… Even after having surgery\Nfor the kind of injury that could prevent him from\Ncontinuing on as a Ninja… – Bushy Brow! 					– Lee! Bushy Brow! Lee… It’s nothing. Grandma Tsunada told me to bring you\Nfor your regular check-up. It slipped my mind.\NI’ve been feeling fine lately, so I just… You don’t look like it though. HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL Rest for a while. You are forbidden from engaging in\Nany missions or training for the duration. There is cumulative damage\Nto your Chakra Network. You were once injured so badly that you had to give up on being\Na Ninja for a while. It’s my self-rule. Your self-rule? Yes! To never forget\Nmy original intentions! As long as I keep on trying,\NI will be able to continue on as a Ninja! All right. I will remove you from active duty\Nfor a while, but you may continue training.\NJust don't overdo it. Yes! In particular,\NI prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus! Got that? Y-Yes… Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go? What’s wrong? Hey! The results were bad. Judging from the way he looked,\NI’d say considerably… By “considerably,”\Ndo you mean that “considerably”? Yes.\NConsiderable, to be sure. Considerable?! What are you so down about?! Lee! Guy Sensei! I heard the results of the exam.\NYou have permission to train, don’t you? Yes, but the Hidden Lotus… That day, you were crying right there… Your surgery will be a success because you have worked hard\Nall the way through. You have the power to bring\Nyour own future in the heavens. And in the one in a thousand— no, one in a million chance\Nthat something goes wrong… I’m going to die with you! Ever since the time I met you, my Way of Ninja has been\Nbringing you up to be a fine Ninja. I promise you! You believed me then and had the surgery.\NAnd it was successful. You must have faith in me\None more time! If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus, then strive to attain an even\Ngreater technique through your efforts! There are no limits in\Nthe face of your efforts. Sensei! You are a genius at effort! Yes, sir! I'll give you some training for\Nthe first time in quite a spell! First, dash to the Academy practice hall! Please instruct me! If you don’t get there in ten seconds,\N it’s 500 push-ups! Right! The Third Super-Beast! It was rash of us to think we could\Nmake it in ten seconds, after all. Just as well! Five hundred… It’s been a long time since\N I smelled this smell… Who is he? That’s Yagura.\NHe’s been here for a week. An acquaintance asked me to determine\Nwhether he has aptitude as a Ninja. His name is Yagura, you say? He’s pretty good, isn’t he? Yes, he has the instincts for it. He absorbs the things I teach him\Nlike sand absorbs water. Oh! You’re Rock Lee, aren’t you? Y-Yes… I hear that you have superb techniques. Sensei has told me about you. No, nothing that great… Don’t be bashful, you. – Master Guy? 					– Yes? I would like to receive some instruction\N from my senior. Fine, then. Begin! Huh?! Guy Sensei! You came to train, anyway. First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner\N and warm up. I see… He’s a spring chick who has just arrived,\Nso try not to let him get hurt. Right. What’s Bushy Brow doing in\N the Academy practice hall of all places? I thought his condition was\Nconsiderably bad! Yes, considerably! Considerably! – Huh?! 					– Huh? I’m inexperienced,\Nbut please instruct me. Oh, please bear with me, too. Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both\Nto give it all you've got but to also observe\Nthe greatest courtesy. That is friendship!\NThat is youth. Get ready. Fight! H-He’s fast! Let’s have you show me… The depth of the Taijutsu that\NMight Guy drilled into you! What power! Every single blow is heavy! I haven’t the strength to absorb them! Leaf Hurricane! Closing off the escape path above\N and strike from a low position… However… The Leaf Hurricane was defeated! Stop! Hold it right there! Lee! Are you all right? Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow! What was that that just happened? The Cross Method… Meeting the opponent’s kick and pinning his foot between\Nthe knee and elbow simultaneously— a “bone-crushing daring technique .” Where on earth\Ndid you learn that, Yagura! I didn’t intend to do that. My body just moved\Nlike that involuntarily… Sorry, Lee. Are you all right? If Lee hadn’t been wearing his weights,\Nhis ankle would have been crushed. It was a splendid move.\NWell then, let’s continue with the practice. Let’s stop here for today. I’ll take you to the hospital to\Nhave them look at it. No, I’m completely fine, I tell you… We knew from the health check-up that Bushy Brow’s injuries were\Nconsiderable to begin with, didn’t we? Considerable! What was considerable? I’m telling you,\Njust considerable, right?! – Probably considerable…\N– Considerable, I tell you! Even with the weights on, that speed… What was considerable?! Fortunately, there’s nothing wrong\Nwith the bone. I see. Um… When can I begin training again? Huh? What are you saying?! You’re going to need complete rest\Nfor a while. It’s amazing that your Achilles tendon\N remained uninjured, you know… You said considerable, so… I misunderstood it to mean that\Nhe was in a considerable condition. But… he came out from the examining room\Nlooking very down, so I just assumed… To be sure, he seems dispirited. He was beaten by a trainee\Nwho isn’t even enrolled in the Academy. A trainee? Lee? Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu\Nfor only one week. In any case,\Nhe was incredibly skilled, that… What’s it called…? The Cross Method! Yes, that! He's a genius to deploy\Nthat at the instant! I hope Lee isn’t feeling down, though. If he were the kind of guy to get\Ndownhearted about a thing like that, Lee would have quit being\Na Shinobi a long time ago. – Huh? 					– Huh? When Lee was in the Academy, he was told that he had neither\Nthe talent for Ninjutsu, nor any talent for Genjutsu. Had it been me,\NI would have given up long ago. But Lee got to where he is now purely\Nthrough effort and persistence. If he can just heal his injuries, he’ll soon outstrip anyone with\Nnatural talent alone. – That’s true.\N– Darn right! But… I’ve heard that if you train too hard, you can wreck your body and\Nbecome a decrepit… Don't say such a thing!\NYou’re talking about Bushy Brow! I’m only kidding.\NJust a slip of the tongue. – Don’t even say that in jest!\N– Decrepit? I know, I know. But actually, we are grateful to Lee. Huh? Grateful? Yes, grateful. Okay, today I’m going to teach you\Nabout self-rule. Self… …rule, you say? Yes! Yes! Yes! Please teach me! Me! Me! All right, ready? To all things there are principles, and to efficiently make use of things\Nin daily life, human beings have rules. Okay, today I have something good\Nto give you all. – Something… 					– …good? This! O-Oh! These tights of the type that\NI habitually use…! They have outstanding ventilation\Nand moisture-wicking properties! Developed for ultimate ease of movement,\Nit's a complete of of super-athletic wear! If you wear them when you’re training,\Nyou’ll feel the difference immediately! You won’t be able to do without them! Next thing you know,\Nyou’ll be wearing them all the time! Yes, yes, yes!\NPlease, by all means, give me a pair! Oh, I got a pair of those myself.\NThey look cool, don’t they? Oh… Is that so? If it weren’t for Lee… This is youth! This is guts! This is Harutaro Minami,\Nspring chicken of the South! – You got that all wrong!\N– You got that all wrong! I’m really glad that we’ve had Lee around. Yeah, me too… I’m sure a C-rank mission would\Nfeel insufficient for you, but there’s nobody left to ask but you. Leave it to me. Oh, by the way,\Nthere’s someone I’d like to take with me… Yagura! When my foot heals,\Nlet’s train together aga--? I feel no need to take lessons from you. Even ruling out the fact that\Nyou were wearing weight, there seems to be nothing worth\Nstealing from you… Stealing? After all, skills acquired\Npurely through effort make you nothing\Nbut a pale imitation of Guy Sensei. What did you say?! As proof of that,\Neven Sensei has given up on you. That can’t be! Guy Sensei promised me… that his own Way of Ninja was to\Nturn me into a splendid Ninja, too! Well then, I wonder why he’s gone\Nso far as to ask me to come on a mission with him\Nfor practical training… Not you, but me! You? Too bad. There’s no way effort\Ncan win out over talent. Wait! Did Sensei really asked you to…? No, it…can’t be true… Lady Tsunade! Wh-What is it? Yagura has been injured and\Nis under protection. What? Guy was with him.\NWhat on earth happened? No! Yagura is said to have been attacked\Nbefore reaching Hidden Leaf Village. Then the trainee Yagura\Nthat accompanied Guy is… A total imposter. Damn it, one nuisance after another…! So, these three are the ones\Nthat can be mobilized? What shall we do? Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto… these three go after Guy\Nand the phony Yagura! Right! Wait! Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee. If he learns about this, he’s apt to dash out,\Neven in the shape he’s in. Right! Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei\Nwent this way? Without a doubt! His destination was\Nthe Land of Mountain Streams. He must have gone through this forest. There’s another way to go,\Ncutting through the mountains, but it’s too dangerous. Yagura, are you with me? Yes, Guy Sensei! Don’t slow down! Take each step after first taking\Nthe measure of the mountain terrain! Right! Lee could run through here blindfolded. What’s wrong? Yagura? Oh no! Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura! Yagura! He may be a genius,\Nbut he’s still a trainee… I wonder if I expected\Ntoo much from him… Yagura! What? Were you in such a place? Wooden Training Dummies\Nfor kung fu training… Oh my… It takes me back to my youth. I trained with a burning spirit on\Nthe same kinds of Wooden Dummies. It makes my body to just start\Nmoving uncontrollably. But why are there Wooden Dummies\Nin such a place? Who in the world…? And for what purpose? They move well for dummies. But, after all, they just look\Nlike automated dolls. They only have one pattern of movement, and no matter\Nhow many of them there are, their reach only extends for\Na diameter of 3.5 meters, so they cannot attack. What? Mister, you can move?! What the heck?! Hey? Can’t you see anything yet? Neji! Even using the Byakugan,\NI can’t find a single footprint. They can’t have gotten that far away,\Ncan they? They wouldn't have used excessively\Ndangerous mountain paths either… However they seem to be able to move, they’re just stick figures crawling\Nover the surface of the ground… Mister, you can jump, too?! Not just yet! Wh-What a…! pleasant, high-energy training place…! 6,985… 6,986… 6,987… 6,988 6,989… 6,990… 6,991… – There is no limit to training.\N– 6,992… – Even if I cannot use my legs,\N– 6,993… – my upper half is still in good shape.\N– 6,994… – Guy Sensei thinks…\N– 6,995… – my training is inadequate.\N– 6,996… – That’s why he compared me with Yagura.\N– 6,997… 6,996… – to show me that I wasn't doing enough.\N– 6,998… 6,999… 7,000! – I have faith in Guy Sensei!\N– 7,001… 7,002… They’re moderately powerful, but… their movements are monotonous.

Exactly. Hey…Pervy Sage,\Nwhat’re you going to do about this? Here, he was supposed to\Nwatch my training. You did that to him. He interfered with my research. Research? I’m a writer.\NI’m writing a novel. This is it. Make-Out Paradise Oh, that is…! You know this? I’ve gotten quite famous. That’s not much of a novel! In the first place,\Nwhat research you are talking about? You’re just peeking at the girls’ bath! – Yikes! 					– No! Idiot, idiot…idiot!\NMy peeking has been found out. You pervert. F-Fool! I’m not just a pervert. I get inspired by peeking\Nand can write better pieces. Liar! No excuses. More importantly, what’re you\Ngoing to do about my training?

Join my training, hey! Shut up! I hate people who\Ndon’t know how to talk properly… And I don’t like men. Oh, umm, umm… That Make-Out Paradise was\Nreally exciting, cool and interesting. The purchase or viewing of that novel is\Nprohibited for those 18 years or younger… You liar. The reviews that I‘ve heard are great. It’s useless to flatter me.\NI’m a sage! I’m not the type of fool who can\Nbe coaxed by a fledgling like you. Oh, hey…wait! Farewell, kid. Wow! He’s cool even\Nthough he’s a pervert. Heeey, Pervy Sage! Where’d he go? What’re you doing,\Nyou old pervert? No, no, I’m sorry, miss…\Nbut what lovely breasts… Pervert! This grown-up is disgraceful. Maybe there’s nothing special about him,\Nafter all. But there’s nobody else. Good grief… As usual, the women in\Nthis village are strong-minded. However, that’s makes them so good. “As usual”?\NMeaning you’ve come here before? You. And you did nothing but peeping, right…? You Pervy Sage! Don’t say pervert, pervert\Nin such a loud voice. Shut up! So I bet that one shot on\Nthe closet pervert was a fluke… Anyway, I’ll have you take responsibility\Nfor ruining my training! Whoa… Jeez, you’re a noisy brat. Hey! Be quiet inside here for awhile. Hey! Let me out, you jerk! I want to have a romantic encounter\Nwith a stacked girl. How dare you do that to me earlier! Substitution Jutsu. Sure enough,\Nhe’s not an ordinary old man. Humph! That punk… It’s a million years too soon\Nfor that kid to take me on. Not really. It seems you have a bit of talent. Then you’ll watch my training? Give and take! I'm not averse to listening\Nto your favor as long as you listen to mine. So which is it? Listen up… Nice ripe fruit that looks like this,\Nlike this and this. I’ll watch your training\Nif you bring me that. You really will, right? This Toad Mountain Sage doesn’t lie. Okay, wait! Plans are plans.\NThey don't necessarily have to happen… Hello there, you ladies! Oh my… You’re funny, old man. No-no, this is the solemn truth. Yeah, and then,\Nwhat happened then? Hey, Pervy Sage! Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said. You fool! Who’s a Pervy Sage? I brought the promised item. Nice ripe fruit.. Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!\NThat’s not IT! Looks good! Don't hesitate. Help yourself. Thanks. No! Where’d the ladies go?! I got my fill… Ladies… No doubt about it. That person is… Good grief. I’ve wasted time… Hold it! Where are you going?!\NWhat about my training?! I don’t care! My precious research\Nhas been ruined thanks to you. Research, my butt!\NI can’t be standing around here, either! I’m going to train hard,\Nbecome stronger than anybody, pass the Chunin exam, and then I’ll exceed the Hokage! Humph! I don’t care about such things. Here all you do is get in my way… Jeez, what a repugnant brat! Stacked girls like the ones\Nfrom earlier are indispensable for\Nmy great writing enterprises! I see… So I should bring\Nsome stacked girls, right? Okay. W-Wow…! If you gaze at me like that…\NI feel embarrassed. Oh…! What a… What a cute girl. I like you! You pass! Idiot. You’re really my type of girl.\NWhat’s that technique called? It’s called Sexy Jutsu. Oooh, what an idea. You’re a genius. I get the feeling all adults are\Nreally affected by this technique. Then you’ll watch my training? Sure! However, I have a condition. A condition…? What is it? A-Always be…in that form\Nwhen you’re in front of me! Hey! Sure enough,\Nyou’re just a pervert! You Pervy Sage! No! I’m not just a pervert! As if you didn’t know! I’m a super pervert! Darn it… He’s gone defiant… Well, brushing off the stuff until\Nnow as a joke, I’ll watch your training. You mean it, right? A sage doesn’t go back on his word. Okay, kid. Do that training that you were\Ndoing before one more time. Okay! Okay. Darn it. Totally worthless. Shut up! It’s pointless to wear clothes. Hey, build up your Chakra\None more time. One more time? Just do it, quick. You! What? You’re pretty sexy when\Nyou’re naked. Jeez. I’m concentrating,\Nso don’t interfere. Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue. You’re messing with my focus. I see…So this is The Seal Formula. Two Tetragram Seals\Nmaking a Double Tetragram Seal… Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula? Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking\Nfrom between the Tetragram Seals… and is fixed so that it\Ncan return to this kid’s Chakra. Fourth Hokage… It’s to protect this kid, huh? But after that, it’s stopped\Nwith a Five-Pronged Seal… Putting Odd-Numbered Seal\Nover Even-Number Seals… This kid’s Chakra and that of\Nthe Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled and are not stable. No wonder he is not able to\Nbuild up Chakra very well. That tickles…old man. Oh, sorry, sorry. Perhaps someone else…did it… The formula is rough. Well, it’s probably Orochimaru. Kid, give me a hurrah. What? Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah. Jeez, he’s demanding. Five-Pronged Seal…Release! What’re you doing?! Well, I just pushed\Nthe pressure points for relaxing. Just try walking on\Nthe water once more… Sheesh! What? I don’t know why, but it’s going well! Yahoo! I guess it’s about time to teach him\Nhow to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra. Okay, kid. Come on out. I’ll teach you an ace technique. What, what ace technique?\NA deadly technique? There’s something you need to\Nunderstand well before I teach you techniques. You probably haven’t noticed,\Nbut you possess two types of Chakra. Huh? Two types? Until now, have you ever\Nfelt a special Chakra? Special? Hmm… Come to think of it… Come to think of it,\NI get the feeling there were times when… Chakra suddenly sprang up\Nand an awesome power came out. But…I don’t really remember those moments. I see. But I do remember sensing that\Nit was different from the Chakra I always build up. If I liken it to colors, while it’s always blue… it felt like it was red or something. I see. Okay. That’s it for today’s training. What?! Already? What happened to the ace technique? I can still train. With training, a watched pot never boils. As long as we’re here,\Nlet’s have a bath… Not just falling in… Warms me up. A drink after training’s the best. Say, say, Pervy Sage. What kind of technique is\Nthat ace technique? You’ll find out tomorrow. Miser! We’ll turn into boiled frogs if\Nwe stay in here too long. Ebisu, sorry for snatching\Nyour student. It’s okay. More importantly,\NI was surprised… The Hokage has had us searching\Nall over for you and we could never determine\Nyour whereabouts. To think you were in this village… The Hokage will be pleased. Did you tell the Third Hokage about me? Not yet. I see. That’s for the best. Sure enough, something\Nabout Orochimaru? No, unfortunately not. What?

Shikamaru! What’s the matter? There’s a smell of blood nearby. Wh-What’s this?! Raido! Genma! This isn’t good! I can’t believe these two\Ncould have been taken down…! The best I can do right now is\Ngive him some stop-gap treatment… Shizune… I’m gonna hunt those guys down! No! B-But… W-Wait…lwashi. Th-The Jutsu that those guys have\Nis no longer that of mere Shinobi… If you pursue them alone,\Nyou'll only die. Genma…don’t talk anymore! The smell of the other two impinged\Non the five others including Sasuke… But the five are moving away\Nfrom the smell of the blood! What should we do?! Just as I thought.\NHe has guides. This has really turned into\Na real pain in the neck. Let’s hurry up and pursue Sasuke! Shut up, Naruto! That’s for Shikamaru to decide!\NDon’t play the boss! Shikamaru? The fact that there was\Nthe smell of blood probably means that a battle occurred somewhere. If we go to that location we should\Nbe able to gather some information… We must be attentive\Nas we near the location, so we would have to switch over to a reconnaissance pattern\Nand approach walking slowly… While all that’s going on Sasuke will cross over\Nthe Land of Fire border! What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?! All right! Let’s pursue Sasuke! All right! That’s what I was waiting for! However… The fact that there was a battle\Nmeans they’ll have their guard up. They’ll certainly be aware of the fact that there might\Nbe Ninja on their tail. In other words, the odds are high that\Nthere will be traps or an ambush. Listen carefully… Hereafter, I want you to use your visual\Nand acoustic senses to the fullest! We need to locate those guys before\Nwe get caught in an ambush! And if we come across\Nanything suspicious, don't just dodge them,\Ninterpret them! All right! When we find them, I’m gonna use my new Jutsu\Nto clobber them! That Naruto… Each time I see him\Nhe’s added a new Jutsu to his arsenal. Darn! Just when I thought\NI had caught up with him… Hey! The enemy’s smell is everywhere! Everybody! Stop! Take a careful look above you. Paper Bombs… And in five other places too! The figuration is that of\Na Perimeter Barrier. Perimeter Barrier…? It’s one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu! Perimeter-type traps have a time lag\Nand are activated when one enters the area that\Nhas been marked by the enemy. It’s advanced Jutsu… It was in one of the books that\Nmy father made me read. Darn! Our only choice\Nis to make a detour… Lee… Do what you have to do! Lee! It’s too soon to be doing that! Lady Fifth Hokage! I already know that\Nyou’re a foolhardy guy. But you’ve just had an operation. You don’t need to be rushing\Ninto things. I want to hurry up and\Ndo even a little training. I also want to… I want to… Building your strength isn’t\Nthe only form of training. Don’t you agree? It is said that Ninja are those who can forebear and\Nendure any hardship. I understand how you feel but… That means that this too\Nis one kind of training. Training… What if you were to do something foolhardy\Nand you got worse? Wh-What’s that? It’s medicine that I prepared. First, drink this and get better! Right! Come, let’s go… Yes, ma’am. Damn! Nothing but traps! Yeah, but the enemy seems\Npressed for time. The traps have noticeable flaws. Hey, hey, Naruto!\NThere’s wire at your feet! Don’t trip on it! I know that already! Wait, Naruto! Shadow Possession Jutsu… M-Made it just in the nick of time. Naruto! I told you to be careful! I see… One of the wires is\Nreadily visible because it reflects light. The other wire has been coated\Nwith a matte green. So it’s very difficult to see\Nwith the naked eye. It’s a double trap, huh. Despite the fact that\Nthey’re in a hurry, that’s certainly an elaborate trap. Which means that… That they’re at rest. Perhaps they got injured,\Nor that itself could be a trap… Byakugan! Caught ‘em! All right! All right!\NI’ll drag Sasuke back without fail! Naruto! Hate to tell you this, but I’m gonna demonstrate\Nmy new Jutsu right here! Me too! Don’t be so hasty. As soon as preparations have been made\Nto implement my strategy… we’ll make direct contact\Nwith the target! Darn! When we’re in a hurry,\Nhaving to take a darn break… It can’t be helped. When one fights at the second state,\None’s body gets drained drastically. More than that, it’s an ordeal not to be able\Nto use one’s body for a while… It can’t be helped with\Ntwo Jonin-class guys as the opponents. If we act in moderation,\Nwe’ll be done in. Kiba… In that event, don’t mess up the timing\Nof the Smoke Bombs. Got it! Now then… we'll split up into two teams. – Right! 					– Okay! It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet. Hey, Sasuke's not around. It appears that… He’s inside that “coffin.” Is he dead?! That barrel is secured with Barriers.\NI can't see through it. I wouldn’t think that the guys\Nwho wanted Sasuke would kill him that easily. You might be right about that. Once in a long while, once in a while The remnants of a person\Nbroken by dreams Look like a mountain Clinging to the Divine,\Nclinging to Buddha The remnants of a person crying Look like a mountain Rendezvous with a happy dance circle This is my victory pose, round and around\N (round around) Shake shake shake\NLet’s look With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Gimme a break, Shikamaru!\NYou're not reliable in the least! And you still call yourself\Na leader?! But this situation sure\Nis a problem. Leave this kind of thing to me.\Nlt'll be a cinch. – I sure hope it will be.\N– What do you mean by that?! It's too much of a hassle to explain. – Shut up, Akamaru!\N– Shut up, Akamaru! What was that?!\NGive 'em some more, Akamaru! Well, if things come to this,\NI'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!

188,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Mystery of the Targeted Merchants Did they really come this way? But why come this way? They shouldn’t come this way\Nif it’s as you say, Choji. I said that because I didn’t think\Nwe were being targeted. I don’t think this is\Nthe time to argue… We have to formulate\Nsome sort of strategy. You say that, but… What is it? Have the guys\Nyou spoke of caught up? Then we should divide up\Nthis group in two. Here it’s hard enough\Nto protect one. What’s the point of dividing\N the group in two? N-Naruto! Please, tell us what your idea is. This is what I mean. For example… Let’s say there are\N ten persimmons here. Is anything okay\Nif it’s a food? Yeah. Then I want it to be ramen! Naruto, it’s an example, so… Then we’ll make it ramen. Someone is after\Nthese ten bowls of ramen. And there are three people\N to protect the ramen. And so one person has\Nto protect roughly three bowls. No, no. If it’s ramen, we should just eat it all\Nbefore they come. That would settle things. N-Naruto. This ramen is\Nfor delivery to someone, so we can’t eat it. Really? But the ramen\Nwon’t be tasty if it gets soggy. I’m moving on. If three people protect\Nten bowls of ramen, one person protects\Nabout three bowls. But this ramen has\Nlegs for escaping. Ramen with legs for escaping?! Five bowls of ramen\Nquick to escape… and five bowls of ramen\Nslow to escape. Right, right..\NThings are kind of getting crazy. I see. If we divide them\Ninto two groups… Of course, the pursuers would target\Nthe group that is slow to escape first. So we have one person\N defend the preceding group and two people\Nfor the group that is slow to escape. Right, right. By doing this, as for protecting\N the slow group, now one person can just protect\Ntwo and a half bowls. Oh! In other words, the ramen that are\Nquick to escape are the young people and the ramen that are slow to escape\Nare the elderly people and children, right? Exactly.\NNot only will the possibility of the former to completely\Nget away increase, the burden on the latter\Nto protect will decrease. It’s a strategy that kills two birds\N with one stone. You’re smart. However…\Nthe elderly people and children will… I just stated a rational idea. There’s the possibility of complete annihilation\Nif we stay in a group. Am I wrong, Yurinoshin? Well… Then it’s settled.\NLet’s divide everyone up in two. I’m sorry, gramps. Don’t worry about it. It would be trouble if something bad\Nwere to happen to the men in their prime. You’ve got a wife and kid\Nat home, right? Then we’ll be going on\Nahead first, Naruto, Choji. Right.\NWe’re counting on you, Hinata. Naruto and I will deal\Nwith the pursuers. Right.\NI’ll protect them well. Lady Haruna. Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut.\NWhat’s your mission? Is it not to protect me? Things will be settled if Kikusuke\Ndefeats those guys. Then shall we get going, too? I’m counting on you, Brother Choji. Right! 					Leave it to me! Choji. You go on ahead. What? I’m going back to check things out\Nat the place where the traps are. But if you do that, you may encounter\N the pursuers along the way… That’s fine. Doing something like waiting\N to be attacked isn’t my style! Naruto! Leave it to me! I meant… There’s no point to our strategy if I have to protect five people\N by myself. Right, there’s no point. We came down that path, so the trap should be\Nup ahead somewhere. I guess I’ll take a shortcut! What’s this? 					What happened? Why is it so wet? What’re these wounds?! This guy’s…! Are you serious? Is something wrong, Brother Choji? No, nothing. I see… I feel it. Even I can sense this much bloodlust. It’s close now. Huh? Rain? This is the worst. Rain wipes out\Nall presence of the enemy. Oh… This rain is weird. Gather around, everyone! Stay close to me. What’s…this? This is bad! What was that now?! Everyone! Get under the cart! We’re already under here! You’re quick! Choji! Naruto! Get down! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! Could you say so\Nat the start if you’re going to\Nuse paper bombs? All right. It seems they’re gone. Why did they disappear? Isn’t it obvious? They have no business with a shop\Nthat doesn’t have the thing they want. Thing they want? That’s right. If a shop’s sold out\Nof the item you want, you’d go to another shop, right? Could it be that the thing that he wants\Nis in the other group? What does that mean?! Hinata’s in danger! Everyone, leave your stuff here\Nand take only what you need! Hinata is?! Everyone, we’ll put up our tents here\N for today and rest. It’s dangerous to move in the dark. Hey! We finally caught up. Naruto, Choji. What is it? “What is it,” nothing.\NThe situation has changed. It seems someone among\Nthese people is hiding something important. Something important? It should probably have something\Nto do with us being chased. But who is hiding what? It’s most likely you guys,\NShun and Yurinoshin. Don’t be silly!\NWhat’re you saying we’re hiding? Don’t play innocent! Kikusuke has been killed\Nby someone! What?! Kikusuke was?! Don’t play innocent! Kikusuke has been killed\Nby someone! What?! Kikusuke was?! Why should he have to\Nsuit up like a Shinobi, fight those guys and then get killed?! It’s not necessary to tell you guys. But if that’s why we’re being chased… It means you guys are putting\Neveryone in danger. If you don’t tell us honestly, we won’t be able to protect\N even what we can protect. Kikunojou… Kikunojou? You mean Kikusuke? Yes… And my name isn’t Yurinoshin.\N It’s Yurinojou. Stop, Yurinojou! The person here is Lady Haruna, the only daughter of the feudal lord\Nof the Land of Greens. Princess?! Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens.\NYou’ve grown up so much… P-Princess…? You were a woman?! Lady Haruna,\Nit is as these people say. We must not put everyone in danger\Nby hiding the truth any further. But why is someone like a princess\N mingling among merchants? There was information of\Na coup in the Land of Greens. A coup? The Land of Greens was a small,\Nbut calm and peaceful land. However, it was by no means\Na prosperous land. Before we realized it, more than half of the public officials\N had been bought off. Who in the world would do that…? The ringleaders are three brothers\Ncalled the Janin, evil Ninja who came from\N across the sea. Janin? Yes. They’re guys who use\Na particular type of Ninjutsu and are called as such\Nbecause of their frightfulness. They’ve taken many lives\Nand think nothing of it if it’s for their own gains. They treat people like worms… But why the Land of Greens? I don’t know why. But his lordship had Lady Haruna\Nhide amongst a group of merchants and got her out of the land. Kikunojou and I were left\Nwith the protection of the princess, but we were insecure with\Njust the two of us. So then we hurriedly commissioned\Nthe Hidden Leaf under the pretext of protection\Nfrom bandits. Why didn’t you tell us\N something that important? There’s no way I could have.\NMy escape is top secret. Besides, what would happen\N if I were to have told you? The end result would’ve been\N you guys running away in confusion. No way would I do something\N like run away. Kikunojou might not have\Nhad to die if we had understood the situation\N from the start. I wonder. One of you guys might’ve ended up\Nlike Kikunojou. We’re actually fine. But to think you’d go so far as to involve\Nthe old lady and the children. It couldn’t be! Were you intending to use\N the old lady and the kids as decoys and escape just yourself?! That’s right. What of it? Choji! Hinata! As for me,\NI’m really tickedoff right now! So what of it?! If something should happen\N in the land, I would become\Nthe only blood relative of the feudal lord of\N the Land of Greens. If I can just survive,\Nthings could be restored someday, even if the Land of Greens\Nwere to be destroyed. Say what?! Just what is it\Nyou think of people’s lives?! Please forgive her. Yurinojou. Is it not your mission to protect me? You’re still talking about such things…? Please wait, Naruto! Lady Haruna, that’s true for me. However, these people are different. The mission they undertook\Nwas to protect merchants. It was not to protect us. Indeed, what we heard about was a D-rank mission to protect\Nall of the merchants. Protecting a prominent figure of\Na land is an A-rank mission. The rank differs by far too much. Are you guys saying\Nyou’re going to forsake me? Weren’t you saying until just now that you didn’t trust people like us? I’ll protect you with my life,\NLady Haruna… Shut up, Yurinojou!\NKikunojou was your senior disciple. There’s no way you alone\Ncould defeat an opponent whom he couldn’t defeat! That will just be our destiny\Nwhen that happens, Lady Haruna. Watch, Brother Choji. Oh! Awesome, awesome. I’m sorry about earlier. It happened so suddenly,\NI couldn’t stop. Don’t be concerned about me. However, please forgive Lady Haruna. The Land of Greens is a small land. For the sake of the land’s survival, Lady Haruna was kept under\N the custody of another land, as a hostage all by herself\Nsince she was little. Hostage? It frequently happens in\Na small land in a war-torn world. When Lady Haruna returned\N from the other land, she had completely lost her feelings\Nof trust towards people. Lady Haruna is also\Na victim of a turbulent world. There’s a village about one league down\N the mountain from here. For the time being, we’ll leave the old woman\N and the others there. Be careful now. You guys, too! Bye! Why are you separating them from us? They still have value for\Nmy personal use. Are you still going on about that? They went so far as to discard\N their merchandise for your sake. Then we should also leave this place. We must not. If we go into hiding, there’s a possibility of\Nthat group being attacked again. Exactly. This time,\Nit’s our turn to be the decoy in order to protect them. Do as you like! Hinata, I’ll take care of things here.\NPlease rest a while. Yeah, do that. Th-Then, if you insist. Oh, yeah. Here.\NKikunojou was holding this. Thanks, Naruto. Kikunojou was a master\Nof the Flower Ninjutsu passed down in the Land of Greens. We learned together\N when we were little and I couldn’t beat him even once… Now I have forever lost\N the chance to beat him. No… You still have a chance. What? If you beat the guy\Nwho defeated Kikunojou, you will have beaten Kikunojou! Naruto… You’re exactly right…! Here they come! Other than the fact that\Nthe enemy uses water, we have absolutely no idea\Nwhat they’ll come at us with. I know. Go! Flower Ninja Art:!\NFlying Flowers: Falling Foliage. What?! He changed the trajectory in mid-air?! Oh, no! I finally got you! Gotcha. To think you’d\Nmake me look like a fool. So you finally show yourself. I will avenge Kikunojou! Try it if you can. I won’t let you get away! Too bad. You’re one person short. I’ve set a share for one more. I don’t know about that. First, I’ll take care of you, boy. Water Style: Liquid Memory! Naruto…! And this! Summoning Jutsu! What is it? Is that…? The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?! Vanish and die! Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone.

Is it really true that this gal\Nis the Kunoichi who can heal any kind of wound? What about you? What do you want from me? I’ll be straight with you. Tsunade, the village has demanded\Nthat you become the Fifth Hokage. Hey, ol’ man,\Ngimme the simmered meat with potatoes! All right, in a moment. The Fifth Hokage?!\NWhat’s this out of the blue?! What the heck is going on?! Do you know about the Third Hokage? The Third Hokage?\NSo, he really was… Orochimaru did it, right? I heard about it.\Ndirectly from him. Orochimaru did it…? Orochimaru?! Did he really killed the old man,\Nthe Third Hokage?! Who is this Orochimaru?! Just like us, he’s one of the Sannin. Why?! The Sannin are all\Nfrom Leaf Village, right? Then why--?! Who’s this brat? He’s Naruto Uzumaki. This brat is…\Nthat Nine-Tailed Fox…? Hey, you just hold it there! I am not done talking yet! This Orochimaru?!\NThis bastard that killed Old Man Hokage. Who the heck is he?! He’s a legendary Sannin, right?! Then knowing that… why would you, Pervy Sage,\Nleave such a guy alone?! Besides… What do you mean this person\Nis the Fifth Hokage?! Naruto, be quiet for a moment. But…! Just shut up! I’ll say this again. They are demanding that\Nyou become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade. So what’s your answer? Will you accept it? I’ll resurrect the little brother\Nand man, both of whom you loved… This time, I will completely destroy Leaf! What do you say…Tsunade? Lady Tsunade… I really don’t get it! Impossible… I refuse! I remember…those words. You said those same words\Nwhen I asked you to go out with me. What the heck are you talking about?!\NYou said it yourself! Didn’t you say that\Nyou will bring her back to the village and have her treat Sasuke\Nand Kakashi Sensei ?! But what’s this demand\Nfor her to be the Hokage?! And, on top of that, she refuses! Lady Tsunade… Could she be thinking of making\Na deal with Orochimaru? Calm down. There can’t be no other Fifth Hokage,\Nbut this Tsunade. During the dreadful Great War Era, she contributed tremendously\Nto the Leaf’s victory. To this date, there’s no one who can rival\Nher combat and medical skills. Still more, this Tsunade is\Nthe granddaughter of the First Hokage. So together with her talents, there’s no one else more suited\Nto becoming the Fifth Hokage. If she becomes Hokage, that means that\Nshe’ll come back to the village. And then, as I’d told you,\Nshe can treat the two. Besides, this is what the Leaf’s\Ntop decision-making advisors settled upon. Genin like you have no say\Non this matter. Jiraiya… Unlike your previous apprentice, this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,\Nhe’s ugly to match. What?! It’s tough on anyone to be\Ncompared to the Fourth Hokage. He had all the qualities to be\Nthe greatest Ninja in all history. Brimming with talent in Jutsu,\Nand he had a brilliant mind! Popular with people and well…\Nhe was as handsome as me. But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly. Risking his own life for the village… Life is different from money… To easily risk it and lose it,\Nis a fool’s doing! Did she say “fool”?! Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage seemed to want to subdue\Nthe disturbances of war above all else. But after all, they died in vain, in the midst of their dreams\Nfor the village. You have changed, Tsunade… I don’t know what\Nyou thought in your heart before, but to say such thing out loud… Although I look young,\NI’m already in my 50s… Years change people. Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei… No wonder he died showing off\Nat that old age! Hokage is a bother. No one but a fool would take it on. Why you--?! – Let go of me!\N– Don't! We're in a pub. I said, let go of me! Lady Tsunade…! Anyone who makes fun of the old man\Nand the Fourth Hokage… It doesn’t matter if\Nyou are a woman! I’ll clobber you with all my might! You’re pretty gutsy…\Nconfronting me like this. Let’s take this outside, brat! Lady Tsunade! Though I may not look it,\NI am one of the Sannin. Why should I even take a Genin seriously. What did you say?! An advance notice for a KO? I don’t mean one minute… With one finger.\NThis is enough to take you down. Lady Tsunade! Well… Come on, kiddo. D-Don’t make fun of me! Darn it! Lady Tsunade! Forehead poking?! Why that no good--! She’s strong… Hey, brat! I’ll ask you one thing before you faint. Why…get so passionate at\Nthe mention of Hokage’s name? Unlike you… I will be the heir to the Hokage name,\Nno matter what! Because Hokage is… Because Hokage is my dream! That kid… What? She’s a bit off her guard… I can’t tackle her head on. Then, I should use that Jutsu now… Concentrate! Oh, no! Wha--?! This Jutsu is…! Take this!

It really couldn’t be helped… the situation in\Nthe Village being how it is… And anyway… I’ve taken the minimally\Nrequired measures. Hey, hey! Your mission has already\Nbeen assigned! Uh, I’m gonna go do an errand\Nand will be back shortly… Don't worry. Geez… Kakashi Sensei! Kakashi Sensei! It’s already been two days\Nsince Sasuke left the village… And Naruto and the others who went in\Npursuit haven’t come back either. And neither has Lee… I know. I’ve more or less\Nheard the whole story. I…believe in Naruto! I believe him, but if something were\Nto happen to Naruto and Sasuke… Sakura, you don’t need to\Nworry about anything. Leave this to me. Summoning Jutsu! First of all, I want you guys to\Nfan out in all directions in pursuit of Naruto\Nand Sasuke’s scent. Naruto and Sasuke you said? Did something happen\Nto the two of them? I’ll explain later…\NRight now, time is of essence. Okay. As soon as you confirm that\Nyou’ve detected the scent, call me and I’ll be there immediately. All right! Scatter! Well, I guess since she saw them\Nfight before her very eyes… it’s useless to tell her\Nnot to worry. Stop! Damn… I can’t stop… Sasuke… Stop with revenge. What?! Even if you were successful\Nin carrying out your revenge, all that will come out of it\Nis a sense of emptiness. Shut up! What do you know?! Don’t say that so knowingly! Well…calm down. Neither you nor I could\Ncall ourselves lucky. Of that much I'm certain. But it could be worse. Both you and I have found\Nprecious comrades, right? We understand that all the more\Nbecause we’ve lost them once. I taught you Chidori because you now have\Nprecious people. That power isn’t something to be used\Nagainst your comrades or for revenge. You know what that power\Nshould be used for. I’m gonna win no matter what! Don’t get so carried away! I was too naïve… Watching them, they might actually\Nbe intent on killing each other… Kakashi Sensei… Please let me get there\Nin time! I already said this earlier but… In truth, you were waiting\Nfor this too, weren’t you? Neither Kakashi nor Sakura\Nare present right now. So there’s nobody here to stop us\Nlike that time before. You…! This time around we’re gonna\Nsettle this for real! I will take you down! Chidori! You idiot… Same here!\NI’m gonna clobber you… and take you back home even\Nif I have to drag you! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan! It wasn’t meaningless… To me, you became\Nmy closest friend. Sasuke actually came out\Nand said that…to me… And that’s exactly the reason why\NI wanted to verify it using this Rasengan. Damn… Damn you! Damn… He was able to counter my full power of Chidori\Nto that extent… That jutsu… Damn… Naruto, to what extent…! That loser… Naruto…! Well, your limit is two blows…\Nthat’s about it. And if I try to use more than that… what will happen? The third blow won’t initiate. Remember that well. If you try to initiate\Nthe Jutsu forcibly… not only will the Art not\Ninitiate properly, but your Chakra will become zero… In the worst case scenario\Nit will cost you your life! Damn… I can’t waste a blow… It wouldn’t serve any purpose\Nif we cancel each other like earlier. There’s…no longer\Nany mistake about this. You…really intended… You really intended to… Sasuke…! I will use numerous speedy techniques\Nand Jutsu to create an opening. And then…I will make\Na hit with Chidori. Sasuke… Did you know, Naruto… Top-class Ninja should be\Nable to read each other‘s hearts simply by an exchange of fists. Even without saying anything… You’re naïve, Naruto. How about it? Were you really able\Nto read inside… this heart of mine? Fire Style:\NPhoenix Flower Jutsu! Sasuke… I knew that you\Nwere always alone. At first, I was relieved\Nwhen I found out that there was\Na guy similar to myself. And it also made me happy… To tell the truth, I really wanted\Nto approach you right away. But…I wasn’t able to approach you… – Awesome…\N– You’re incredible… You were always able\Nto do everything. And moreover, you were always\Nbeing praised by everyone. Because you and I\Nwere so different… Because I didn’t want to admit it,\NI decided to call you my rival. I didn’t want to lose to you… and I felt that even more strongly… because I was called a loser. Even when we were\Nin the Squad Seven, I continued to feel\Nthe same way the whole time. I’m stubborn… And wasn’t able to express\Nwhat I really felt… What I really wanted was\Nto become like you. You were what I aspired to…so… You are one of the ones\NI want to fight. I was really happy when\Nyou said that! Those were your first words…\Nacknowledging me… You and I both knew, without us even having to\Nhave an exchange of fists! From that time on… Even without saying anything… The fact that… we are friends! It’s not without meaning… To me you’re… my closest friend. However…you’re trying to\Ntake me down for real. Right now, I don’t really know whether you really meant\Nwhat you said earlier or not. Thinking that we were friends… That might have been… That might have been just me… It’s too late now! Naruto! If that’s the case…I’m… really lame, aren’t I… Sasuke! But… It can’t be helped, can it? I don’t know why but… I don’t know why… But I… I… don't want you… you to be taken away\Nby someone like Orochimaru! You managed to divert it\Nwith your left hand, but it was meaningless. You won't be able to use\Nany hand sign or that Jutsu earlier anymore. This is the end! Wh-What’s… that red Chakra…? Where does he get that\Nkind of power from?! W-What the heck…is this?! His shoulder injury is healing… That’s unbelievable! Sasuke! I’m not gonna let\NOrochimaru take you away! I will stop you, even if I have to break every bone\Nin your arms and legs! When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… Don’t you talk stupid like that!

If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying Then I want to deliver you a smile,\Neven if I’m not by your side Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands I can feel it so close, Our two hearts Kiba! Naruto! You okay, Kiba? Yeah… Is this also Genjutsu…?! No one, including Akamaru,\Ncan escape from Yakumo’s Genjutsu. It’s because… we have an enlarged neural tube…\Nthe cerebrum… Guys, move away from the door! Parasitic Insects. Please, Sensei…\NTell me the truth. If you don’t…I’ll rub you out… I reached the decision\Nto seal your Genjutsu power at my own discretion. It has nothing to do with\Nthe Third Hokage… Vent your resentment… The only one you should hate is me… I heard…! I heard you and\Nthe Third Hokage talking about trying to destroy\Nthe Kurama Clan! Yakumo, you’ve got the wrong idea. You lie! No way could my mother\Nand father die in just a fire! My parents were killed…! What?! Shino… What’s this?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! All right! I’m counting on you guys! –Right! 					–Right! Now, I’m ready when you are… One, two… Charge! Go! N-Naruto… Naruto?! Kurenai Sensei!\NWhat happened to your…? Yakumo, did you do this…? That person tried to eliminate me… So she’s just facing the consequences. You’re wrong! Yakumo, you’ve\Nmisunderstood something. I heard everything about you and\NKurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai. Stop, Naruto! Listen up.\NKurenai Sensei sealed your powers because she cares about you! What’re you talking about?! You’re not the only one who’s suffering! Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all\Nthis time and has suffered alone! Stop! The…truth…? The Supposed Sealed Ability Guy Sensei! Hey, where is everyone?! Shino and Hinata are standing\Nwatch in the hallway, but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto are now inside the world\Ncreated by Yakumo’s Genjutsu! Huh? What do you mean?! I’ll explain… Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy. No… I must now\Nexplain the truth… Nobody has taken such affectionate care\Nof Yakumo as Kurenai. Kurenai’s resolve was to get Yakumo\Nto give up on being a Shinobi… Yakumo was completely in low spirits. Lord Murakumo was also concerned… Then one day, that incident occurred… The residence of the head family\Nburned to the ground and Yakumo stood motionless\Nin front of it… I saw it at that time… The form of a monster with\Na face like a female demon hovering in the flames…! After learning of its identity…\NI became frozen with terror. What is…the truth?! Sensei… What the heck is happening\Nto Yakumo…? This is bad…! Yakumo! You don’t know… You don’t know anything! Something’s… Yes… There is something…\Nin the recesses of my mind… But… What is it…?\NI can’t remember… Oh no…! Naruto, stop that! Huh?! Naruto! What is this thing?!\NDamn it. Let me go! All I want to do is live up to\Neveryone’s expectations, and yours. And yet…\NWhy does everyone get in my way? I just want to become a Genjutsu user… People have their respective\Nappropriate paths. You probably have your own path. That’s right… There’s no need to force yourself\Nto become a Shinobi… No… I don’t want that! Everyone may comfort me with words… But I know.\NI know they’re disappointed in me. I can’t stand having to live\Nmy whole life feeling that burden. Yakumo, what’s that…? R-Run, Uroko! Yakumo! I remember… Yakumo…?! Yes…me… The person inside me killed\Nmy mother and father…! I killed them with Genjutsu! No, Yakumo!\NThat wasn’t you… You and that monster are different! No, we’re not different… You see, that thing…\Nwas living inside my heart. Thanks… Kurenai Sensei… Goodbye… Stop! Yakumo! Wh-What’s…that…?! In order for us to get\Na clear picture of the incident, we first requested\Na complete examination of Yakumo… As a result, we learned the monster\Nthat appeared at the time of the fire was an Id Monster so to speak,\Ncreated by Yakumo’s sub-consciousness. An Id…Monster… Then I made a direct appeal\Nto the Third Hokage… Ultimately, Yakumo could\Nnot endure the weight of living up to our expectations\Nfrom the time she was little and that triggered her sub-consciousness\Nto attempt to expunge everything. Yakumo’s sub-consciousness\Nwill probably attempt to expunge the Kurama Clan\Nand eventually the entire Leaf Village. I cannot consent to that… Despite such a risk, taking the life of Yakumo who has\Nno awareness of evil cannot be allowed! It’ll be too late once her sub-consciousness\Ncompletely awakens! Then we just have to get her\Nto learn how to control it herself… or seal her powers if that’s not possible. But… Although slightly different\Nfrom Yakumo’s case… There’s a precedent of a baby being used\Nto seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit. That’s absurd…! There isn’t a Jutsu practitioner who can seal the strong powers\NYakumo possesses… There might be just one person\Nwho can accomplish that… However, it will become\Na painful mission. Hopefully, this person can teach her\Nhow to control her powers… But if it comes to sealing her powers, the Jutsu practitioner will end up\Nerasing all the potential in the child… The Jutsu practitioner will\Nhave to live with the burden of Yakumo’s resentment\Nin place of the Kurama Clan… The Third Hokage said that\Nand then cried. The one who accepted that\Npainful mission was… Yuhi Kurenai. I see… So that’s what Kurenai Sensei\Nwas talking about. I…didn’t know anything about Sensei… I knew that Kurenai had sealed\NYakumo’s powers… But it’s the first time I’ve heard about the incident\Nher sub-consciousness caused. Yes… The Third Hokage passed away and at this point, it’s a secret known only\Nto the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai. She made herself into the bad guy\Nand kept the secret, huh…? Kurenai Sensei…! You go, too! –But… 					–Sakura… I’ll take over things here…! Guy Sensei… You’re concerned about Naruto\Nand the others, right? Go to them…! Right! I leave Yakumo…to you… What is it…? I don’t know… But… This feeling… It’s somehow\Nentirely different from before… My insects are acting strange. What’s going on inside?!\Nls Kurenai Sensei okay? It’s powerful… A massive Chakra beyond compare\Nis being produced…! Naruto… Why…? Why do you have\Nto take your own life…? What…?! What must be destroyed are the ones who forced you to shoulder\Na heavy burden and on top of that,\Ntried to eliminate me…! Who’re you…? I crept into an opening in the depths\Nof your mind and was nurtured. My name is Id…! She’s finally awoken… Kurenai Sensei,\Nwhat is that thing? It happened soon after I was made\NYakumo’s personal instructor. It was when I had doubts about\Nthe high level of Yakumo’s Genjutsu and looked into her deep psyche. I discovered that thing! I could only stand motionless\Nin front of that terrible figure. It wasn’t Yakumo whom\Nthe Third Hokage said to eliminate… It was her Id monster… So that’s what it was…? This ominous ghastliness…\Nis more powerful than before. But I must stop it from getting\Ninto the real world, even if we have to kill each other…! Kill each other?! 					I see… She was that determined… So that’s why she quit Squad Eight. I’ll take your feelings into this body\Nand settle the score… You jerk! You’re in the way. Move it! Naruto! I don’t know\Nwhat the heck you are… But Kiba, Shino, Hinata,\Nthey’re all waiting for Sensei’s return! Naruto…! Shadow Clone Jutsu! My Jutsu won’t activate in this world…! You are a thorn in my side…\NI’ll erase you first. Look out! Yakumo, you’re the only one\Nwho can defeat it now! What…? Listen, Yakumo… All people have\Na fanged beast in their minds… It always lives in the depths of\Na person’s mind and will suddenly appear. The power of the beast that\Nappears is enormous and regardless of one’s own will,\Nit can inadvertently hurt those around it. But…if that monster can be tamed and then controlled\Nwith one’s own power… It becomes a magnificent power and acts to make\Nyour dreams come true. Now, fight! Abate by your own hand\Nthe monster you created! B-But… Yakumo, only you can do this! Die, boy… Darkness in my mind, abate! Die! Why…? 					I…served…you well… Kurenai Sensei,\Nyou’re back to normal! Kurenai…Sensei… You did well, Yakumo…\NYou defeated your own darkness. Sensei… You did it, Yakumo… Yakumo… She knew exactly who was\Nreally trying to save her… –Kurenai Sensei! 					–Sensei… It’s okay now! Kurenai Sensei… You’ll go back to being\Neveryone’s teacher, right? That’s right… My final mission from\Nthe Third Hokage is over… –Sensei! 					–Sensei! That’s great that things could\Nget back to normal… Sakura…! Naruto…? I will too. The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by This isn’t funny!

You must not believe\Nin their sweet talk… Their wishes…\NMoreover, Tsunade, your wishes… And dreams…\NDid you forget them?! I’ll be straight with you. Tsunade, the village has demanded\Nthat you become the Fifth Hokage. The successive line of Hokages have protected the Leaf Village\Nand those living in it. They brought troubled times under control and helped the village to prosper. They risked their lives for\Nthis dream, this ideal! You don’t have to answer right now. However, I want it in a week. Also, two human sacrifices are\Nneeded for this Forbidden Jutsu, so do what you need to do\Nto prepare them. We are starting! C’mon. Place your bets! Which will you bet on, ma’am? Which one? C’mon! Which one will she choose? If she agrees to our conditions, your arms will be healed, and the destruction of the Leaf Village\Nwill continue immediately. Lady Tsunade will also be able to\Nbe reunited with the two whom she loves. But if she doesn’t agree… I’ll have to force her to heal my arms… Will it really be that easy? I have you. There’s no need to worry. I’m the one who knows her the best. And her greatest weakness! She’ll definitely accept the conditions…\NDefinitely! Listen, in this third step, you’ve got to use 100%\Nof what you have learned… And retain them. In other words, imagine creating a single layer\Nwithin the balloon and compressing the Chakra inside it. I know that in my head… But no matter what, I can’t completely hold 100%\Nof my power in a neat ball… Don’t give him false hope by teaching him\Nsomething he can't master. That’s why the moony kid\Nstarts joking about becoming a Hokage! Tomorrow, huh. Come again, okay? I certainly will! Are you going to meet\NOrochimaru again? To think she’d be that shaken up… Something extreme must have happened. That one week bugs me, somehow… And Naruto hasn’t come back\Nto the inn for nearly a week.

How about going out for a drink? Tomorrow will be the one week\Nyou promised to Naruto. I wonder what became of Naruto? Beats me. I guess I’ll have something. Radish, please. Coming up. Oh? Here you go. Ooh! This looks good. Lady Tsunade! What happened to Naruto? He’s quite exhausted and weakened. And his right hand is severely burned\Nwith Chakra… As it stands now, this kid probably won’t wake up\Nuntil the day after tomorrow. It’s as Jiraiya says… Why did I make such a stupid bet? What am I, of all people,\Ngetting so worked up for? How stupid. Tomorrow… Please don’t go tomorrow! Why don’t you say anything?! Lady Tsunade! Please don’t be silent.\NPlease answer! If you say that you’re going… What will you do? I’ll stop you with my life! Shizune… Have you forgotten\Nwho you’re talking to? Sir! It’s morning, now!\Nlt’s about time you went home! Geez. Hey!

It seems that you… You don’t trust me completely…yet. Precisely because I trust you… I would like to leave Sasuke\Nin your hands. Well, then… Kabuto… If you wish to stop me… You have no choice\Nbut to kill young Sasuke, now. You can’t possibly kill me… Hey! I said hey! Naruto…? Oh no! What time is it?\NNo, what day is it? It’s Monday… What is it? Is your body okay? As I recall, you were supposed\Nto sleep for two full days… No matter what the wound, I’m always able to recover\Nif I sleep one night! That’s right.\NThis kid has Nine-Tailed Fox’s power… More importantly,\Nwhere’s that stupid old woman?! Today’s the promised bet day.

At any rate, Naruto…\NTo think you’d be here, too… Hey! Shizune. Y-Yes?! It’s about time you tell me what the heck she was talking about\Nwith Orochimaru. Orochimaru?! I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade… That’s why I couldn’t say until now. But… There’s no time.\NPlease come with me! I’ll explain as we run! Okay! I’m going, too! What’s your answer? Say what?! The answer to that is definitely no! This might be really bad… She’s probably still thinking\Nof those two. Perhaps I may have no choice,\Nbut to kill Tsunade… Dang it! I’ll heal your arms… In exchange for that,\Nkeep your hands off the village. Very well. Now then… He’s planning to once again attack the Leaf Village if\Nhis arms are healed!

As you can see, the Land of Sea is made up of\Na group of islands of various sizes.

The people on the boat who\Nwere victimized unanimously claim that the damage\Nwas done by the “Demon of the Ocean.” And exterminating this Demon\Nof the Ocean is the mission? Well… more or less, yes.\NBut there’s more. The Land of Sea does not have\Na hidden village of its own, so they’re prepared for contingencies through military cooperation with\Nthe neighboring country, the Land of Water, and have been paying them\Na retainer every month… However, the other day,\None of their ships that collects funds was attacked by\Nthe Demon of the Ocean as well… I see. To preserve their relationship\Nwith Land of Water, Land of Sea will do anything\Nto protect the next ship.

It’s like a fish, like a person...\NWhat is this?! Huh, someone’s eyes are playing tricks.\NSomething like that can’t exist! Not true, it’s possible that Ex-Ninja\Nbecome pirates and use Transformation and Genjutsu. Well, whatever, if we don’t gather\Ninformation, there will be no solution. Right… Mother Island is the biggest island\Nat the center of Land of Sea… We’ll go to a nearby fishing port\Nand cross over by boat! – I understand!\N– I understand! Yeah! Let’s depart for the Land of Sea! This guy is always hyper… I'm anxious about what’s going to happen. Here you are… Um… Lady Tsunade… Hmm? It’s about…Anko Mitarashi just now… Did, uh…\NDid something happen in the past? Sort of… Oh? This is… Her record of missions from about\Nthe age of ten is pretty sporadic. Because Anko was under Orochimaru... So the parts that are blacked out are combined\Nwith Orochimaru’s movements… and in the confidential file? Part of them are… Huh? There are some parts\Nthat aren’t recorded… That’s the truth. No record?! Even though\NAnko herself was in the village? That Orochimaru… It seems he really didn’t\Nwant to be traced… When he left the village… He erased part of Anko’s memories. The wind is salty… Coming this far, we can already\Nsee over the Land of Sea. Then, that must be the Mother Island? What ? What is this feeling? Everyone… Sorry but… Go ahead and take care\Nof the arrangements for the boat. What? But, what would you do, Sensei? I’ll take care of some business\Nand join you… See you! Oh! Sensei?! C’mon, it can’t be helped… What are you doing, Shino? We’ll leave you behind! Yeah… The Curse Mark aches. This presence… No question about it. This way? I can say their names\Nwithout a problem! Um… That’s Mother Island… These are Taro Island and Jiro island. And… That there’s Demon Island! Seems you prepared before you came… I want to become a wiser, stronger\NShinobi like you, Master Orochimaru… Oh…? Here. Sorry, but I can’t give you anything\Nmore than this. What’s up…lno? Hey, mister! Aren’t you bringing prices down\Nway too much? That’s high-quality fish, isn’t it? Oh dear… I’m not price-cutting… See... Because of that\N ""Demon of the Ocean""  uproar, customers are completely staying away... This is the market price around here. Really? That fish is rarely…\NOh! What’s with her appearance?\Nls she injured or something? No… That girl, she has her reasons. Well… She’s a female diver from a small town\Non the cape of Mother Island… What?! Why would a woman diver on\NMother Island transfer islands on purpose? That’s because, the island people\Ndidn’t want to do business with her… That girl… In the past, she was spirited away… Spirited away…? A person suddenly disappears…\Nis that it? That’s right! In the past, a lot of island people disappeared\Nfrom being spirited away. The story is that out of all those people that girl was the only one\Nwho suddenly returned one day. Hey, hey! It’s a little village… So everyone felt creepy. They say that now, she lives alone\Noutside of the village… I see… I feel sorry for her. With her appearance...\NAnd then you hear things, I too... feel a little bit creepy… That's true. Hey, where’s Naruto? I don’t know… Hey! What are you guys doing?! Oh no! Hey, are you okay? Yes… You’re uh… You’re from a place called\NMother Island, aren’t you? Hm? Uh… Nothing… Ninja… Oh, I’ll help! That’s okay… Huh…? H-Hey… Wait. What the…? It’s too bad but, the last boat from\Nthe port has already left. But the sun hasn’t even set yet… Around here, there’s nobody who\Nwill take you across in the early evening... Sorry, but come back tomorrow. No way… Well, is there a way to get to\NMother Island besides the ferry? Mmm, I can’t really advise it, but… If it’s necessary,\NI’ll let you borrow my little boat. Hey! I was looking all over for you guys! C’mon! Where were you?! Sorry, sorry… You should at least say something\Nbefore you disappear. You and Sensei are exactly alike,\Nsuddenly going someplace. Feels like there’ll be\Na bumpy road ahead. What?! That’s rude. Placing me in the same category together\Nwith that unreasonable sensei--! Who’s what? S-Sorry. This sensei… is dangerous, after all… Good work procuring the boat! S-Sensei… Where in the world\Nhave you been all this time? Oh, something like\Ngathering information… Well, let’s go! The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here… Land of Sea must have\Npleaded with them to investigate on\Nthe “Demon of the Ocean.” Well then, we should give them\Nthe best welcome. It’s getting dark… We’re almost to Mother Island. All right, all right! Full speed advance to Mother Island! Although the sun has already set ... Where does all your hyper-energy\Ncome from?! Times like this,\Nyour state of mind is important! Sakura sure has her share of trouble…\NI feel sorry for her. What the…!\NI ran up against a rock or something! Hang in there, Naruto! Hey, all of you look forward, front! Dodge it, quick! You say that, but… It’s no good, the oar won’t move! I’ll help! You…! Striking Shadow Snake! Naruto! Leave it! I understand!

Please come out, Chief Toad! Hey, good evening! It can't be!\NI have been calling for Chief Toad! Stupid! If you summoned\Nthe old man to a place like this, terrible things would happen. Huh? Why?

Where did he go? Damn it! My visibility is too bad… Hey, pull yourself together, Naruto! Big Brother, it itches. Ah, I’m at my limit, too… B-Big Brother! This is not so good. Naruto! What happened? You two are?! I’ll discharge all the Chakra\NI absorbed at once… Water Style: Furious Current Jutsu! Shoot! I can’t approach them\Nso easily with this. Naruto… I can’t stand this!

You’ve been condescending to me and saying whatever you\Nplease since earlier on! Since I summoned you,\NI’m your master! Huh…? What was that? Hey, who do you think\Nyou’re talking to?! A little squirt like you, who isn’t even able to exchange cups\Nof sake as a pledge of friendship, is saying to Lord Gamabunta,\Nthat you’re his master? I could kill you for that! Hey!

And by my doing that I’ll make\Nyou recognize me as your master! You little brat! Don’t get all carried away\Nthinking I’ll go easy on you! Huh?! Fall! Chakra adhesion! There’s not enough Chakra! Listen carefully, Chief Toad! My name is Naruto Uzumaki! I’m a man who will become Hokage\Nin the future. Don’t forget that! Who cares! This is getting pretty interesting. Hey! Oh my gosh! Sorry Naruto,\Nbut I’ve gotta get back to work! Research…research… Bust off! Welcome! I'm gonna eat my fill. Huh... Those guys are\Neathing barbecue again, huh? A reward for having trained\Nearnestly…maybe? I thought you were told not to\Nlet Gaara out of your sight… Don’t worry…\Neven somebody like him… wouldn’t dare to do anything\Nin broad daylight. More importantly,\Nthat guy Shikamaru or whatever, he’s the first guy\Nyou’re fighting, right? Shouldn’t you be formulating\Na battle plan? Humph… There’s no way I would\Nlose to a guy of that level… Besides… You botched it, didn’t you? Huh? If you had taken the exam\None year earlier, you would have made\Nthe Chunin easily… Don’t say it… What was that?! The upcoming Chunin Exam… I’ll have the three of you from\Nour Sand Village take the exam… But the reason for doing that\Nis not to pass the Chunin Exam! It is to use the opportunity\Nof the Chunin Exam… to crush Leaf Village! But why…? Don’t we have\Na treaty with Leaf Village?! That treaty is the problem. Oh. What do you mean? You Genin are not aware of\Nthe detail but… At the time the treaty was concluded, that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind\Nnot only aggressively scaled down the arsenal of\Nthe Hidden Sand Village… he delegated to the Leaf Village matters that should have been handled\Nby our country, and moreover, significantly cut our country's budget\Nand slashed the number of Shinobi. When we have an idiot leader, we, the arms and legs\Nof the country, suffer. The only choice we had left\Nwas to improve the quality of each and every Shinobi in order\Nto maintain our country’s military power… That’s why Shinobi like\Nyou were created… Gaara… The Land of Wind’s security is\Nin extreme danger right now! But the aides\Nof that idiot feudal lord… don’t have a clue! Lord Kazekage , who detected the weakening in the military\Nstrength of the Hidden Sand Village, joined hands with\Nthe Hidden Sound Village and decided to take down\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village… In addition to restoring Sand\NVillage authority… this needs to be done in order\Nto make that idiot feudal lord aware of the importance of\Ncrisis preparedness… If any more time passes,\Nour Sand Village will totally lose its military capabilities\Nagainst the Leaf Village … Now is the only chance … The success of that mission…\NGaara…depends on your work… Yeah… If the strategy is carried out, it will certainly lead to war\Nwith the Leaf Village. We’ll be at war again…? The cost to human life in implementing\Nthe treaty was very great… and if it is broken…then again…\Nmany people will die… H-Hey…Temari… This is the will of Lord Kazekage. Of Lord Kazekage? After all, Shinobi are simply\Ntools for fighting. The treaty did nothing more than\Njeopardize our very existence. This is a super A-rank mission. See it through with great care! Okay. Yes… A day sure is long when\None’s not doing anything. I guess… Darn… What an obstinate little squirt. Goodness…that Naruto seems\Nlike he’s in agony… He must have exhausted\Nmost of his Chakra when he summoned Gamabunta… Look, look, isn’t that pretty… The rainbow… Gorgeous… Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn’t it. Good work, Baki. Lord Kazekage, I successfully\Nmoved all three pawns to the real battle as planned. The agreement with the Sound Village side\Nhas been progressing with no problem too. Yes, sir. This is… A decisive action plan from\Nthe Sound Village. You still have something you want? Well… What is it? Come out with it. Yes, sir…I was wondering if you\Ncould position some soldiers near the border on the pretext of\Nundertaking a tactical exercise. With only the four of us… The Leaf Village isn’t idiot either. Their Anbu black ops\Nare moving about. If we do that, they will see right through\Nwhat we’re contemplating. But with only our current\Nmilitary capability… That’s why I sent Gaara and\Nthe others out there. The restoration of the authority of\Nthe Hidden Sand Village is resting on you. Well… Go. Yes, sir. There’s only a little more time remaining\Nuntil the sun sets completely… and if I don’t fall off… I’ll be the master! What’s that to me?! You came up with this\Nwhole thing unilaterally. I’m not falling off, no matter what! That Naruto…\Nhe’s already way past his limit… I wouldn’t be surprised if\Nhe fell off any minute now… I could simply ignore what\Na brat like him says… but taking a lick really irritates me. I'm gonna bring this\Nto an end once and for all... Hey, brat…what’s your name? Naruto! It’s Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto Uzumaki… Naruto! Don’t hold it against me if you die! Oh… That Gamabunta! Now it’s a matter of pride for him, too! Huh?! This won’t do! No! This is the sizzling young ladies’\Nentertainment spot! I’m not falling off when\NI’m so close to succeeding! Hey! Oh… What?! That Naruto… He’s squeezing out yet more Chakra\Nfrom that condition he’s in. I’m falling… How do you like that, Gamabunta?\NI’m still on your back! It’s my victory! Oh no! If he falls like that he’ll die! Too bad for you… You almost made it. To think that he could hold out like that\Nagainst a tough opponent like Gamabunta… Hm?! That, Jiraiya, meddling in… I am fully aware of the fact that… this guy here summoned\Nme all on his own. I mean, it’s the first time since\Nthe Fourth Hokage that somebody climbed on my head. As might be expected,\Nhe must be totally drained. I don’t mind dispensing some\Nof my power to him but… Taking him to that place would be best. Huh? What! One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two!

Thank you… Is your leg okay?\NThe one you cut with the scythe? D-Did I tell you that story?! No…I kind of found out… How? No one else besides me\Ncame today or yesterday, right? No, I just saw it from here… Scary! As time went by everyone began\Nto fear me since I had the power to know what was happening outside\Neven from my room. Did you know?! I heard that Ranmaru has\Nthe ability to see everything… Were we being spied on every day? Get out of the village! You monster! And so I had no more visitors… All I could do was to wait to die. That’s when Raiga saved me… I see. What a bitter past. Yes, it is. Hmm… Raiga took me out to\Nthe unknown world. Ranmaru, try opening your eyes… This is the outside world where\Nwe’ll be living from now on…okay? Okay… If Raiga isn’t here,\Nit’s the same as losing my body.\N131.01	01:36:52:09	01:36:54:13	Perhaps Raiga became known as one of the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist because he was able\Nto borrow your power. It seems like you two\Nhelped each other to live… Yes. That’s not true! You were being used for\NRaiga’s evil deeds! I might have been…used… But good or bad doesn’t matter to me.\NI’m just a sense organ… Then that won’t mean\Nthat you’re really living! Huh? See, you have to do your best\Nto live from now on! Firstly, eat the curry of life\Nand cheer up! That’s right!\NYou will get nourishment. That will hurt the body instead,\Nwouldn’t it? Naruto, you can’t eat it either, right? Actually, the more I eat it, the more energized my body feels… That curry saved my life, you know! Until the day you’re able\Nto walk alone, I will become your body! Okay? I have one favor to ask… Huh…? Byakugan! As I expected…\NI can no longer see life in Raiga. Can you see, Ranmaru? Yes. Is this okay? Yes… Let’s go… Mission is complete. Hey! What? That is--! One, two, one, two. Grandma Sansho! What’s all this ruckus?!\NDust will go into the curry. L-Lee and the others came back! K-Karashi is with them! Is it worth the ruckus? Grandma, aren’t you happy? One, two… One, two… Your snot will go in! Grandma Sansho! I’m back! Karashi is here too! M-Mom, sorry!\NPlease forgive me! Please forgive him… He says he’ll devote himself\Nfrom now on, and train to take over\Nthe Curry of Life Shop, so please… First you gotta eat… Huh… Wow, it looks good! If you’re not going to eat, I will! I’ve prepared some for each of you… Oh my, that’s a very pale child. Yeah, can you prepare\Nsome for him too? Especially mild… I prefer mild too… Oh my… Mom…thanks for the food! It’s a punishment times 300 curry… It’s spicy, it’s spicy… But it’s good! It’s good, Mom! Here, I have some for everybody! It’s okay, it’s mild. By the way, you were part of the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist with Raiga, right? Do you know a guy\Nnamed Zabuza? Zabuza…you say? Uh then… How about a guy with this huge sword\Nwrapped with something like a bandage and has fish eyes? Oh…that’s Kisame… Yeah Kisame! So, do you know what\Nhe’s up to right now? No… I heard that he slipped out\Nfrom the Mist Village. I know his face, but I don’t know\Nanything beyond that. I see… Should I ask Grandma to\Nmake you something else? No, I don’t need it…\NI don’t want to eat anything. Thank you for your help… Thank you very much. Make a good village with everyone! Um…where is Lee? His mission still isn’t complete. Please wait, Lee… I’m gonna die! Okay, let’s take a break here! Let’s do 300 push ups. What?! One, two…One, two… 300…all right. It looks like…\Nthere’s going to be a storm. Even if a real storm comes, it should be fine if we reinforce it\Nwith these big trees! Oh my, thanks for doing this. No, it’s our thanks for the curry. Uh-uuh. But compared to you guys,\Nmy Karashi is… Tenten? I’m worried about\NKarashi and Ranmaru whom we left behind\Nat the curry shop. We’re okay,\Nso could you check on them there? Karashi?! Hey… Is the Boss really still alive? That Neji person didn’t seem\Nto sense it then… But I know. Raiga… Oh… You were everything to me! I was only waiting to die… when you told me that\Nwe’ll live on together! To me, being with you, was living… I won’t hold a funeral for you either. Even if it costs me my life,\NI won’t let you die! Ranmaru! Did you die, Ranmaru?! Karashi…? So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here? Even I have times when\NI just don’t understand, baby When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you Even on nights when we’re apart,\NI’ll be close to you I’ll be close to you What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?! Then we gotta go save her\Nright away! Please calm down! Naruto! Tenten can’t be that clumsy. Huh? But that’s what Karashi said. Unfortunately, this might be\Nsome kind of trap. What? Trap? Karashi… Well, didn’t they get annihilated?

And he’s a little cute… Something about it… I’m envious of you… Watching your battle makes me think\Nthat I have to work really hard too… That’s amazing, you know? He won. Is it for real? I thought he was the same as me,\Nin the not going anywhere class… Not going anywhere? Now people are squealing... Looks like he’s part of the group\Nthat’s going somewhere. Maybe I couldn’t beat him… This is really bad.\Nlt kinda depresses me… To retain himself and draw out\Nthe Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox… Yeah… Most of the Leaf Village people\Nhere are surprised. That Naruto… When did he learn to control the strength\Nof Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent? Even a bird who gets caught,\Nonce it learns how, will open the lid of its basket\Nwith its own beak. He won't give up, for he wants to\Nfly freely in the sky again. This time you lost! Father… It’s okay, there’s no damage\Nto his internal organs. It seems like his Chakra\Nis almost used up. You are not the only one special. Why do you act against\Nyour fate that much?! Because I was called a failure… Those who become Hokage\Nare born to that fate. So what?! Lord Hyuga! I’m sorry but…\NCould you step out for a moment? B-But… It won’t take long. Y-Yes. What do you need from me? That day… I came to tell you the truth…\Nabout that day. That day…? At that time, I intended to die! W-What are you talking about?! That day my father… He was killed\Nas your body double! The truth of that day…is here. They're probably only excuses made\Nat the convenience of the head family. The person you are now…\Nshould be able to understand. This writing…! Neji… I only have a little time left. I want to use that limited time\Nto convey something to you… Convey something to me? The head of Ninjas from the\NLand of Lightning, who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,\Nwas killed by Lord Hiashi… But the Land of Lightning didn’t\Nacknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata, made only the killing\Nof the head Ninja a problem, and made unreasonable demands. It can’t be helped. With my one life,\Nthe village can be saved… Wait, Hiashi. Don’t be so hasty! The Hyuga’s Kekkei Genkai\Nis an important strength of this land. It is the duty of the head family\Nto protect it forever… However, for the sake of that duty… if we involve our land\Nin a desperate war…! I understand that!\NThat’s why… Isn’t that why\Nwe have branch families? Hizashi’s corpse…\NWe’ll hand it over as your body double. Hizashi too…\Nunderstands the situation. However, what they want is\Nthe secret of the power of the Byakugan. The point in time that\NHizashi becomes a corpse, that power will be sealed. I don’t believe that the Land of Lightning\Nwill consent to that. That’s their true intent, but the condition made by Lightning is to\N“Hand over Hiashi Hyuga’s dead body.” We pretend that we agreed\Nto their terms, and hand Hizashi,\Nwho is identical to you, over... and they can’t pursue it\Nany further than that. B-But… Hiashi… The time has come… Your predecessors have done the same\Nto protect the power of Hyuga clan. Even siblings…\Nhave the heart to write each other off. That is the fate of the head family. And this…is the destiny of\Nones born into Hyuga! Where has Lord Hiashi,\Nwho is always bullish, go? The scale of this issue is different\Nfrom the ones in the past! It’s not that easy… H-Hizashi…you… Please…let me go. You… You…have Neji. Why do you choose death…\Nfor the head family?! That’s not so! I have been resenting\Nthe head family. To tell the truth\Neven now I’m bitter. That’s why… I want to die protecting you as\N“my brother,” not as the head family. It’s the first time I’ve had\Nthe freedom to choose. I’ve only shown Neji my ugly side. However, now I’ve come here\Nand finally know my own intentions. So please tell Neji… I-I wasn’t killed to protect\Nthe head family… but to protect my siblings,\Nfamily and the land… by my own will I chose death! T-To choose death…\Nyou call that freedom…? Big brother… Once, just this once,\NI wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga. I wanted to choose my own fate. That’s all. Overcome your own fate, Neji… Fate is something you work out\Nwith your own hands. Father… This is…the truth! I’m sorry! Please…raise your head. Father… I wonder if a person’s destiny is\Nonly floating like a cloud in a fixed current… Or is a person able to ride\Non the current that he chooses. I don’t understand it well yet. Whichever, the end point\Nmight still be the same… Just, when the choice is the latter… people turn toward the goal of\Nliving and work hard toward it. And those who hold that\Nare really strong. I feel like I finally understand,\Nthrough this battle… And… father… I have only one goal… I want to become stronger,\Nso I won’t lose to anyone. That’s how I feel now. Father…I see many birds flying.\NAnd they seem to be enjoying themselves. It’s buzzing. That’s because it was a good battle… Certainly, there’s that too, but… It’s likely that, for the curious heads\Nof Ninja and the feudal lords, there is no match they look forward to\Nmore than this next match. By the way, it seems that\Nhe wasn’t seen at the opening ceremony… He’s arrived here already, hasn’t he? There’s been no news of Sasuke. And there’s the issue of Orochimaru. Before everyone starts to make noise,\Nwe should disqualify him… What’s going on?!\NHurry up and start the next match! How long are you going to\Nmake us wait! Before night falls! I wonder what’s going on\Nwith the next match? Is Sasuke here? Sasuke… That guy…\NWhat in the world is he doing?! Is he planning\Nnot to show up? A wise man never courts danger… A wise judgement…is it? What are you saying? He’ll definitely come! Believe it! But seriously, what is he doing? Keep this up and he…\Nhe’ll be disqualified. There’s no choice… Sasuke is…disqualified. Yes. Sasuke Uchiha is…disqualified? It has to be done. What in the world are\Nwe going to do? If that guy doesn’t show up,\Nour plan of strategy… This isn’t good… Could he have…? Where are you going, Gaara? I’m going to confirm my existence… Darn that Gaara… I wonder if he really killed him… Sasuke one more time… What happened? It’s obvious that you’re there\Nstanding with the thirst for blood. Why don’t you come out? It’s you… Lord Hokage… I want you to consider waiting a little bit\Nfor Sasuke Uchiha’s disqualification. I understand your point, but… No matter how excellent the Shinobi, to make light of time is not\Na qualification for Chunin. If there’s no clear reason to satisfy the heads of Ninja and feudal lords\Nwho are here, there’s no reason to wait for him! I see… Well then, there is a sufficient reason. Including myself… most of the heads of Ninja and\Nfeudal lords that are here… came here because\Nthey want to see the next match. However… He’s the remaining survivor\Nof the “Uchiha.” Land of the Wind too, absolutely,\Nis hoping for a bout with our Gaara. Lord Hokage… There’s no guarantee that\NSasuke will come but… All right then… We shall specially postpone\Nthis match and wait. Lord Hokage! Really… Inform so to the Proctor! Y-Yes. However… It’s rare for you to insist like that,\NLord Kazekage. Well… To show off the Shinobi’s qualities\Nof our village to the feudal lords… there’s no better opponent\Nthan an Uchiha. It’s a chance for us as well. C’mon, what happened to the match?! What happened to Uchiha?! I understand… Everyone! The candidate for the\Nnext battle has not arrived here! We’ll briefly postpone this battle\Nand start the following battle ahead of it. What is he doing…that Sasuke? Great, so Sasuke didn’t get disqualified! That’s good… Hey! That means my match\Nis one match closer! Then, on to the next pair! Kankuro and Shino Aburame!\NCome down! My match…doesn’t matter at all. More importantly… I'd rather not expose the Mechanism\Nof Crow to the enemy before the plan… Proctor! I abstain! What?! I abstain!\NPlease advance the matches! Due to Kankuro’s abstention,\NShino Aburame wins by default! What’s that all about?! Have a proper match! You are…? It’s my turn, isn’t it? It seems that you’re really fired up. Okay, let’s go to the next match. Hey! The last one, come down! Hey! Hey! What are you doing,\Nfrivolously building things up? I mean, why does only\Nmy match have to be modified? Shikamaru Nara! You! Damn…\Nlf it’s like this I’ll abstain too… C’mon! Shikamaru, fight hard! Damn that Naruto… One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two!

186,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Laughing Shino Shino! 					Let’s rest a little! I’m tired from doing nothing but\Nwalk since this morning, believe it! You’re okay while\Nyou can say you are tired. It’s because you still have\Nenergy left to talk. Nothing but quibbling as usual… Man, I’m unlucky. To be stuck on a mission alone\Nwith Shino. Hey, old lady. Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead? Are you going to Motoyoshi Village? Yeah! Then you’ll be right there\Nonce you cross this path. Really? Thank goodness. But exercise great caution… Huh? Dead people also laugh\Nin Motoyoshi Village… It will be all over if\Nyou’re lured into laughing. Naruto. It’s Motoyoshi Village. We never imagined it at this time… To think that in this village… an incident too terrifying to\Neven talk about would occur… In Mourning I’m Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner. I’m Shino Aburame. I’m Naruto Uzumaki! Will\N		Getting right down to business… This is the will of my father,\NTobei Kagetsu. What’s this?! My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu, shall inherit the entire\NKagetsu family estate… HOWEVER… A funeral is to be held tomorrow\Nin Motoyoshi Village for the head of the Kagetsu family\Nthat owns that stretch of mountains. I’d like you two to go. Funeral security, huh?\NNaruto can’t do it. What do you mean?! It’s because you have\Nthe most inappropriate face in the Leaf Village. Say what?! I think so as well. But there’s nobody else. So I reluctantly decided\Nto add Naruto. You’ll be the main guy\Non this mission, Shino. You're probably the best suited\Nfor this mission. Huh? As it happens, there’s one more important mission\Nin addition to security. You’ll understand when\Nyou see the will. However, in the event that Futa raises\Nhis voice in laughter at the funeral, he shall lose inheriting rights\Nand upon consultation, the estate shall be divided up between\Nthe bereaved family members excluding Futa. This will doesn’t make any sense at all… An abundance of medicinal herbs\Ncan be picked in the mountains owned by the Kagetsu family. I would have no trouble getting\Nby for the rest of my life if I were to inherit the estate. But all that will all go down the drain\Njust by laughing at the funeral! There’s no doubt that the relatives\Nwill be in a frenzy trying to get me to laugh tomorrow. To be honest, I don’t have the confidence\Nto withstand it. But there is one salvation! According to the will, it’s acceptable if I, the chief mourner,\Nwere to appoint a substitute! And so I commissioned the Leaf! I asked for someone who\Nabsolutely will not laugh! This is no doubt the perfect mission\Nfor Shino. I’ve never seen\Nthis guy laugh before. Indeed, I leave it to you. I understand. Big Brother, dinner’s ready. This is my little sister Mai,\Nthe youngest. She lived together with\Nmy father in this large home. She was also the one at his deathbed\Nduring his final moments. Mai, this is Shino and Naruto. Nice to meet you… Let’s eat! Wait! First, I’ll taste for poison. Taste for poison…?! I don’t think there would be anyone\Namong the relatives who would go that far… But you can never be too careful. You’ve got a point. Will you be all right, Shino? No problem.\NEven if it did contain poison, the Parasitic Insects in\Nmy body will dissolve it for me. Parasitic…lnsects? How is it? It's all right… Shino…laughed?! He seems to be in very high spirits.\NWhich means the food is fine… Don’t eat! Shino laughing like\Nthis is definitely strange, believe it! There’s a laughing drug in this food! Who cooked the food? I did. But the back door isn’t locked… So anyone could get in if they wanted to. To think there would be\Nsomeone in the family who would go so far as to poison! Oh, no…The drug has gotten to the insects! No good…\NThey can’t dissolve the drug. Then what will we do about\Nthe funeral tomorrow?! This is a sight that doesn’t seem\Nof this world, believe it! Naruto! Even if we were to\Ncontact the village now, we wouldn’t be in time…\Nfor the funeral… So Naruto! You… will have to participate in the funeral\Nas the chief mourner’s substitute! No way… Naruto. I’m very uneasy, but I’ll be counting on you. I’m also very uneasy, believe it… Will you knock it off?! I can’t sleep! You’re early, Tsukiko. You’re already here, huh? It’s dad’s funeral, after all.\NI came here in great haste. Who’s that kid? This is Naruto whom I’ve asked to\Nbe my substitute as chief mourner since I’m not feeling so well. Nice to meet you! That’s how it’s going to be,\Nso I will be leaving just with the greetings. I see. But it sure is a troublesome will. To think you can’t inherit the estate\Nif you laugh at the funeral… Be careful. She’s my immediate younger sister\Nin question, Tsukiko. Five years ago,\Nshe married into the next village over… But she’s probably the one\Nafter this estate the most. That kid will be a cinch. Each and every one of them…\Nlooks greedy… What’s that…? The monk has arrived. Why choose a monk like this,\Nof all people? I have no knowledge of this! It’s a different person from\Nthe monk at the meeting. Don’t laugh… Don’t laugh… Laugh… Laugh… Laugh… Now then, allow me to begin. What was that sound? Wasn’t it the wind blowing? Naruto, did you not raise your voice\Nand laugh just now? No, I didn’t!\NI didn’t laugh at all, believe it! Mai, you heard it, right? I don’t know… I only heard the sound of\Nbarrels falling over. Well, fine. The funeral has only just begun. There are still plenty of chances… After all, the opponent is this kid\Nwith a stupid look. I’m saved… Shino, huh? Thanks! That was a close shave… In order, please. Then I’ll go first. Laugh… Laugh… Laugh… No good… He won’t laugh at that... I’ll give it one more push. Don’t laugh…! I must not laugh! This kid is nothing. I’ll kill him with laughter with\Nthat technique of mine… This guy also intends on\Ndoing something, huh? No matter what he does,\Nno way will I laugh! Kiyoyasu! –Kiyoyasu! 					–Kiyoyasu is… Here it comes… Whatever he hits me with. I…! I must not laugh! Laugh… Laugh… Laugh… A flower came out… Don’t laugh…! Laugh… Laugh… Laugh… Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh… Laugh… Laugh… Laugh… I won’t laugh…no matter what! He’s pretty tough… But how long can he hold on for? We’ll make him laugh by the time\Nthe funeral ends without fail! That…old woman… Dead people also laugh\Nin Motoyoshi Village… It will be all over if you’re lured\Ninto laughing. What’s she doing in a place like this? Who’s there?! Uh, oh! Oh, it’s you Mai… With this, it’s over!\NWe’ll put this in everyone’s tea! But… Everything will go well with this! I don’t know about that. Who’re you?! Shino… I heard everything… How frustrating… If this guy would just laugh,\NI’d get some of the estate… Thank you indeed for today.\NAllow me to thank you all… in place of the chief mourner. With this, the mission is complete… It looks like it will somehow\Nend all right. Once the monk goes home,\Nthe funeral will be over. Please wait! Please let my husband say\Nthank you as well. Okay, dear. Hi! Thanks for coming today. Huh? Huh? Wh-What’s he going to do?! It was a very nice funeral.\NI was so moved! It’s tear-jerking. That Tsukiko…\NTo think she would go this far. Naruto, if you can get through this,\Nit will be over. Please withstand it…! It doesn’t hurt at all! I must remember something sad\Nat a time like this! Why do I think of the Pervy Sage\Nat a time like this?! All right, now is the time\Nto finish him off. This is awful!\NThe tears are causing my face to collapse. What’re you talking about? Your face…is right here! N-No! Oh, no… Yes! What? D–Dad… You’re alive? Dad?! Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister! Dad hates fighting! I’ve thought up a good joke. I’ve thought up a good joke, too. Who’re those kids…?\NWhere’d they come from? I’d get dad to laugh, first! I will be the first! You stay out of it! Stop it! Fighting’s wrong! It’s as Mai says.\NFighting’s wrong! Wrong. Futa! Tsukiko! –Futa?! 					–Tsukiko?! N-Now that you mention it… Yeah…They are indeed us\Nfrom our childhood! Oh, fighting’s wrong! A kettle’s a kettle! My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins! Groping is wrong!\NHot sake is where it’s at. My wife’s secret stash is kept in a safe. Between my legs… Ding, dong, ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.\NYeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.\NYeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding. Ding-dong. –That’s right…\N–Ding-dong. Ding-dong. –When we were kids…\N–Ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding. –Dad made us laugh a lot\N–Ding-dong-ding. –with his silly jokes…\N–Ding-dong. –lt’s been a long time\N–Ding. Ding. –since I laughed at dad’s jokes…\N–Dong-dong-dong. Dong –Dong-dong\N–This is it! This is what I wanted to see! Dad! Then who’s this? The laughter stopped. Shino! I’m sorry, everyone! But I didn’t think you’d all come\Nif it weren’t my funeral… Mai helped me out a bunch\Nand this was the plan. Is that really you, Dad? You’re alive. Why’d you do this?! In the old days,\Nbefore we knew that the medicinal herbs we could pick\Nin the mountains would be profitable… We were poor… But we were bursting with laughter. However, we got rich from selling\Nthe medicinal herbs at a high price. And when we’d open our mouths, we’d start saying,\N“Money! Money! Money!” And the smiles vanished from\Neveryone’s faces. I wanted everyone to remember\Nwhat’s important. I wanted to get back\Nthe family’s smiling faces! If I wrote that ridiculous will, everyone would do stupid things\Ntrying to get Futa to laugh. And then not only Futa,\Nbut everyone would laugh and have fun… Happiness isn’t money! It’s living while getting along\Nwith everyone and laughing! I remember… Sure enough, laughter is important. That’s right… To be honest, I’m sick of living\Nat the mercy of money. You liar! You’re the one saying\Nmoney this and money that the most. There are different kinds of “money,”\Nand what I was talking about was… This bell. Could that be…? It’s the laughing drug. It’s still at experimental stage, though. If I made it okay to appoint\Na substitute chief mourner, Futa would summon someone\Nwho definitely wouldn’t laugh. So I tested it out on that person first. I was going to make everyone laugh\Nby putting this in everyone’s tea if nobody had laughed by\Nthe end of the funeral. But… There’s no point to laughter\Nusing a drug… It’s because the people\Nwouldn’t be laughing from the bottom of their hearts. Instead, they’d be crying in their hearts… Like me right now! So at the end of the day,\Nwhat happened with the mission? It's probably a success. It’s because the Lady Hokage probably\Nknew about the real mission. Say-say. You transformed into that old man, right? Then the “Between my legs,\Nding-dong-ding” thing was something you… Forget about that. Absolutely forget about that. O-Okay, got it. Then, fine. Sure enough, I… I can’t get used to this guy… Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone. In a strange park,\NI play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm. Yellow Moon.

That’s my…Ninja Way… I think I’ve heard that line before… You with your destiny stuff… I won’t lose… to a jerk with cold feet like you,\Nno matter what! Naruto… A brat who knows nothing\Nshouldn’t lecture arrogantly! People are born burdened with\Nan inherent destiny that they cannot defy. Neji…live… You’re a man who is blessed\Nwith Hyuga ability more than anyone in the family… I wanted you…to be born\Ninto the head family… You can’t possibly understand the destiny of being burdened with\Na mark that cannot be wiped off for life! Yeah… I do understand it. So…what of it? This brat! Don’t be acting cool… It’s not just you who’s special! Hinata was also…\Nsuffering the same as you! Even though she’s the head family,\Nnot being acknowledged as such… trying desperately to change herself… She fought you while coughing\Nup blood with that in mind! You too! The branch family that\Nprotects the head family… Doing all that to Hinata\Njust because it’s an exam. In actuality, you were just as frantic in attempting to go\Nagainst destiny, right?

You possess two kinds of Chakra… You must extract and utilize, at any time, the other huge Chakra that\Nhas rested inside you from the start… That’s it.

Those who become the Hokage\Nare born with destiny. It’s not something you become\Nby trying to become it. It’s determined by destiny. People must live within\Ntheir different respective currents that can’t be gone against. I don’t know what the\NHyuga destiny of hatred is! But if you’re going to say it’s futile,\Nyou don’t have to do anything! This is bad! I must use the Rotation! After I become the Hokage… I’ll change Hyuga! What Chakra… That kid showed some enormous strength… The Hyuga kid is probably… Say! Which one’s Naruto?! I don’t know, either! Neji’s Rotation is a technique\Nwhere the body rotates, and dodges and\Nrepels the opponent’s Chakra! It looks like there was\Nmore damage done to Naruto since he plunged right into the Rotation. There’s no Genin that can beat Neji… But Naruto, you’re incredible… To think you’d force him this far… Failure boy…\NSorry, but this is the reality… Now this is really the en… My body… So he left a Shadow clone in the hole\Nand spotted a chance to win, huh… Believing in victory,\Nthinking about what’s next and acting even when getting\Nknocked around, huh… The power of believing in oneself.

Fortunately, because there\Nis a downward trend in felonies committed by Shinobi, along with the downsizing of the facility,\Nthe name was changed as well.

This is about a year ago, a Chunin Academy staff member\Nused Naruto to sneak out\Nthe Scroll of Sealing. According to the report, it was\Na crime committed by Mizuki acting alone. The crime was solved, but…? Yeah, if it really was him acting alone. The possibility has arisen that\Na bigger mastermind is behind this crime. This is a clue… This is something that Mizuki\Nwas concealing when he was incarcerated\Nin the Maximum Security Facility. At the time, nobody thought of it\Nas anything more than a doodle. Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway? I don’t know, however… The handwriting resembles\Nthe document confiscated from the facility where Orochimaru was conducting\Nhuman experiments… Which means that…\NOrochimaru is connected to this crime?! The possibility of that is not zero. It’s not like a Chunin alone could do\Nanything with the Scroll of Sealing. It would only make sense if Orochimaru\Nwere pulling strings from behind. Asuma!

You fool! I’ll save you,\Nso you stay right there! Fool! I’ll be fine. You’ll be fine? I can handle this kind of simple task\Nwith my Ninjutsu. Ninjutsu? – Oh no! Young Master!\N– Oh, no! Alligator snapping turtle, Piranha, Toad! Money Style: Help Me Jutsu! What?! – Yay! 					– Mine! Wha--?! Wh-Wh-Wha--?! I’m fine! What are you guys doing?! If you want money hurry up\Nand rescue me. What good would increasing\Nthe victims do? Hey, Kunihisa. Huh? Who are they? Oh, them… Papa employs them and\Nthey protect me if I get into trouble. Really. That’s right, for example… There! See! What do you mean “see”?! Is it okay? I said it’s okay! Really, really okay? What are you so freaked out about?\Nlt’s okay! But still, it’s scary! Cut the bull and come here now! R-Right! But just before that… Ninja Art: Scapegoat Jutsu! See? It’s fine.\NC’mere, quick! If I get on it next,\NI think it might break… Let’s check out a bunch more. I’m not finished yet! More of you! Go! What the--?! Just as I thought. I thought I was gonna die. What were you doing, Kunihisa?! What would have happened if\NI’d got on the bridge like that? C’mon you! Okay everyone, your compensation! Here! I’m telling you, stop that! That kid…\NHe’s got money, huh, Big Brother. Yeah… And his main guard\Nis a single Genin. Big Brother, it’s decided. Yeah. What’s next? Get rid of the savage pig\Nwho appears in the field ahead. Okay! I’ll do my best! What the--?! A savage pig…? More like a monster! Crap! Shadow Clone Jutsu! That’s cool! Naruto! Okay! It’s my turn this time! F-Fool! What are you doing?\NHurry up and escape! Here I go! Ninja Art: Money Clone Jutsu! Money Clone?! Huh?! Hey, you ugly savage pig! Starting now,\NI, Kunihisa, will punish you! Go! Go! Get him! There! What, nobody wants to eat your meat!\NYou dummy! He ordered all of this! What?! I didn’t want to,\Nbut he forced me to… Huh? W-Wait… That’s a lie. It’s a misunderstanding! Those are false charges! Forgive me! Naruto… I… How should I put this…? really hate guys like you! Why are you getting so testy? Geez, poor people just can’t help\Nthat they have short tempers… This’ll put you back in a good mood. Take as much as you want! Enough already! I’m telling you to stop\Ndoing stuff like that! Why? It’s a big mistake to think that\Nanything can be resolved with money! There are times when you have\Nto use your own power! There hasn’t been anything that\NI couldn’t do with money so far! You… Are you always like this? With that personality,\Nyou can’t make friends! It’s okay ‘cause\NI can buy friends with money! What…? You… Buy friends? You mean… If I give ‘em money,\Neverybody will be my friend! Kunihisa… That’s why I hate country Ninjas. They’re cheap and stink of poverty… Stupid! Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa! Running made me hungry. Take this and buy a boxed lunch! There’s nothing like a store\Nto buy lunch around here. Well, snacks will be fine! There’s no convenient store\Nor candy shop… You’re useless!\NThis is why I hate the country! Stupid Naruto. What’s that? Oh, Young Master! Oh! Little fish, little fish! Let’s eat! The kid must be stupid to get\Ncaught in this cheap trick. Don’t you agree, Bro? Yeah! Huh? Naruto?! Aw man,\Nyou’re really high maintenance. Those two guys just now… They were going to catch you! They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever… Whatever…? I’m often a target,\Nbecause I have money. Often a target…? You… More importantly,\NI want to eat more fish! Go find a shop and buy some. You… Still think you can do\Nanything with money? All right, watch this! Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto! How’s that?! You can just get things using\Nyour own power without using money. Even… without using money? Damn! He attacked us by surprise,\Nthat cowardly bastard. I’ll give it back to him doubled! Well, wait… If we do it thoughtlessly,\Nwe’ll just get creamed again. So what do we do? We’ll use that thing. That thing…? Look close at the movement\Nof the fish… Aim for the instant when\Nthey fall after jumping up. Don’t get hasty. Now! Oh! That was close! O-One more time, Naruto! I’ll get the Kunai knife,\Nso one more time! Master Kunihisa! – It’s deep over there!\N– Please be careful! I know, I know… Where did it go? I think it’s in this area, but… I won’t let you get away this time! You guys… We hired these guys with\Nthe money you threw away. It means that now,\Nthey’re on our side… Hey, you guys! I’ll pay you double\Nwhat those guys did! So be on my side… Wh-What the…? Looks like you’ve run out of money. How about you guys over there?\NWanna join us? We’ll pay up stacks of money. Humph! These guys have been\Nwith me for a long time. That paltry sum won’t… We’re not going along with\Nyour selfish acts any longer! Y-You guys?! No! I don’t like it! Annoying brat. I’ll have to tie you up\Nso you won’t move. What are you doing, Kunihisa?! Naruto, I… I… It’s fine already! Hey you… I’ll pay you double what\Nyou get for your mission. Won’t you hand that brat over to us? We’re just going to demand\Nransom money from his parents is all. We won’t kill him.\NRelax and hand him over. I-It’s not enough?\NHere, how about this? Naruto… Kunihisa! Ride on my back! O-Okay. S-Still not enough, huh? Here!\NThat’s all of it! Take it! Like I said… It’s a big mistake to think\Nyou can obtain anything with money! Crap! After them! Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa. Okay! Damn! I can’t move\Nwith him on my back! I can’t see the bottom, Naruto… Go! Okay! You go on ahead. What?! Go on ahead?! There he is! Let’s get him! – Yeah! 					– Yeah! Wh-What are you doing?! It’s okay! Hurry up and jump! I-I can’t… I’m scared, Naruto! It’s not scary, c’mon! I can’t… I’m scared…! Damn it! Do it! Naruto! Well, you’re coming with me! Hurry! Kunihisa! B-But…… It’s okay… You can definitely do this!\NBelieve it! Prepare yourself! No way! Go Kunihisa! Oh, Big Brother! Huh?! Kunihisa?! It hurts!

You are a precious person\Nwho is close to me, Gaara! Always…\Nonly Yashamaru would always… Me…always me… It was an order. I was commissioned to kill you… By your father… Lord Kazekage. My father…? Why did my father…? Why…? Why me? Gaara, you who were born and possessed\Nby the Sand Spirit Shukaku… have been watched over\Nas an experiment. However, Gaara, you couldn’t\Ncontrol the living spirit Shukaku, the Sand Spirit which possesses\Nthe power of the sand. Eventually your existence would\Nbecome too dangerous for the village. Before that occurred… So Yashamaru, you had not choice… but to comply with my father’s order…? No… That is not correct. It is true I accepted\NLord Kazekage’s order. But if I had wanted to turn it down,\NI could have turned it down. Gaara… Deep down in my heart,\NI probably… hated you. You, whose birth took the life\Nof my beloved older sister. The child she left behind in death… Thinking that you were her remembrance,\NI tried desperately to love you. However… I was not able to. My sister didn’t choose to have you. My sister became a sacrifice\Nfor the village, and she died while\Ncursing this village! From that time, I probably… have been burdened with a wound\Nof the heart that could never heal. Unlike a wound on the body,\Nthere is no ointment and sometimes, it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life. A wound of the heart? Your name…\Nis the name my sister gave you. ""This child’s name is Gaara… ""A devil that loves only itself… ""Love only yourself… ""And fight only for\Nyour own sake. ""If you do that,\Nyou will continue to exist."" Such was the hope it contained. However… my sister did not give you this name because she was concerned\Nabout you or loved you. The reason she gave you this name,\Na name so you would continue to exist… …was so that the deep-seated hatred\Nof my sister who died hating and cursing\Nthis village… would remain… and be known to all! You were never…loved! This is the last… Please die… I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara. Love? The sand automatically trying to\Nprotect you is like the love of a mother. I believe that sand is filled\Nwith your mother’s will. Love. Love only yourself. And fight only for your own sake. So that is Gaara…\NThat is me. I finally understand. I am alone. I will no longer believe in anyone…\Nor love anyone. I am alone! Yes, I am all by myself. What’s the matter?\NHurry up and come at me! Don't you care what happens\Nto your so-called precious friends?! Sakura! Dang it! Naruto’s not his usual self… Did something happen between them? In any case… In any case,\NI need to save Sakura! But… what to do?! That’s it! Since it's come to this…\NThough it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra… There’s no choice\Nbut to summon the Chief Gamabunta! Summoning Jutsu! What’s this?!

I… When I learned that the\NNine-Tailed Fox was inside me, everyone in the village seemed\Neven more cold-hearted… I was so deeply troubled… But… Naruto! Let’s go have\Nramen for a change! Yay! I will, I will! I’ll have the one with\Nextra BBQ pork slices! Huh! You loser…\Nlf you want to beat me train harder! Shut up! I won’t lose to you! Hey Naruto!\NWhat did Sasuke say about me? He didn’t say anything… By the way! By the way!\NWouldn't you rather know how I feel…? Oh! Really, Sakura! I’m gonna eat now! Um… Naruto, you’ll really die if you eat\Nonly noodles and sweet red bean porridge. You’re a Ninja,\Nso eat more vegetables! Here, have some! What?! I don’t like vegetables! People appeared\N who acknowledged me… That’s why I became all right, even though there was\Nthe demon fox inside my body, or even if the people of the village\Nlooked at me with cold eyes. Because…\NI wasn’t alone anymore! I never imagined how happy and\Nfortunate I could feel. How really…really… great it was. How truly great it was\Nto be here. I was relieved to know\NI am allowed to be here, to exist! That’s why it scares me\Nto think about the past… That suffering is agonizing… It’s a pitch-black hell! If…I had remained that way, all alone… That’s precisely why I understand! So what did I have in this life,\Nwhy did I keep living? This is the answer I came to… I am living in order to kill\Nhuman beings other than myself. I don’t know what happened, but… This guy’s always been\Nsuffering all alone… Even now, without ever feeling relief… Only able to believe in himself… Even now, he’s battling in hell… That’s how it is… To him, someone like me\Nwho's acknowledged by others… might seem like a weakling in\Na world of happiness without tension… Can I really win against\Na guy like this? What’s the matter?!\NAre you afraid of me? To fight for the sake of oneself?\NTo fight for the sake of others? You should just love yourself,\Nand fight for yourself!

Yeah…The headquarters\Nof the Leaf Police Force. I was curious about it from before, but why’s the Uchiha Clan crest\Non the Police Force mark? Oh… so you noticed, huh? Of course… Yeah…Let me see…\NTo put it simply… it seems the previous generations\Nof the Uchiha Clan set up and established the Police Force. So they used their own crest for\Nthe symbol mark of this organization. From olden times,\Nthe Uchiha Clan has always been in charge of protecting\Nthe public and the peace of this village. The Uchiha crest is\Na testament to the proud clan. The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now. But even now, nearly all members\Nbelong to this first force here. and contribute to maintaining\Npeace in the village. Only even more exceptional Shinobi\Ncan crack down on the crimes committed by Shinobi, so… Sure enough, father’s awesome! Leaf Police Force\N		Are you going to enter\N		the Police Force, too? Well…I’m not sure… Why not?! When I grow up, I’m also going\Nto enter the Police Force, so! Father’s also coming to\Ntomorrow’s entrance ceremony. It’s the first step to my dream. That’s right. You’re late…What were you doing? Father… I have something to talk to you about.\NCome quickly. That's my boy. You’ve come this far just half a year\Nafter being promoted to Chunin. About tomorrow’s special mission… I’ve decided to go with you, too. Tomorrow? If you complete this mission, Itachi… your entrance into\Nthe Anbu Black Ops is almost assured! You understand, right? You don’t have to be so worried.\NMore importantly… Umm… Father… Tomorrow’s my… Tomorrow’s mission will be\Na very important mission not just for you, but for the Uchiha Clan! I’m quitting tomorrow’s mission, after all. What’re you doing talking insanity?! You should know how important\Na day tomorrow is! I’m going to Sasuke’s Academy\Nentrance ceremony tomorrow… The general rule is for relatives\Nto attend the Academy entrance ceremony. There was the notice, right… Father? I get it already. I’ll go to the Academy… Your left leg… Be sure to ice it. Right… Big Brother… He’s so distant… Entrance Ceremony Everyone! Congratulations\Non your entrance! From here on, please work very hard\Ntowards striving for the Shinobi path. And I’d like you to bring further prosperity\Nto the Hidden Village in the Leaf. Gee… I remember\Nthe time when Itachi entered. Just what I’d expect from his brother. Thank you for your help with both boys. Oh, it’s nothing like that. The first prodigy since the beginning\Nof the Academy… There were no students\Nas exceptional as that boy. That’s a bit too much praise. Not at all… I’m hopeful for you, too. Become a fine Shinobi\Nlike your big brother. Yes. Hey…That’s Uchiha, right? Yeah. I wonder…if he’s awesome, too. Hmm…Must be. Recess at last! What a drag.\NI’m still not used to this place… You want some too, Shikamaru? I mean, all of your recesses\Nhave become meal times. That’s my boy… I’ve great confidence\Nyou’ll make it great in Anbu. This won’t do! Won’t do! I’ve got a long way…to go… Really… You should rest your body\Non your days off at least. You don’t have to push it. I heard…that Big Brother graduated\Nfrom the Academy in just one year. The times are different, then and now. Besides, that kid is a bit special, so… That’s my boy… Now, I’m going to hand out\Nthe report cards for the first half. Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy\NNinjutsu: 1st in class and academy\N		lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy\N		Team rank: 1st in class and academy Do a fine job in this vein like\Nyour big brother. Father… I wanted you to say,\N“That’s my boy,” to me… What did you say? What do you mean you can’t participate\Nin the assembly tomorrow?! You don’t understand your own position! I’m setting out on a mission tomorrow. What’re they doing this late\Nat night with the lights off? What mission?! I can’t say…\Nlt’s a top secret mission. Itachi…You also have the role\Nof the pipe which connects the clan with the keystone of the village. You know that, don’t you? Yeah… Keep that well in mind!\NAnd come to tomorrow’s assembly! Sasuke… Get to bed after\Nyou’ve gone to the bathroom. Right… What’re you doing hanging around\Nthis late at night? Get to bed! Okay. Report Card Father only thinks about you, Big Brother… Am I loathsome to you? It’s okay. It’s logical for Shinobi to be\Nill-thought of by people, so… That's not how I feel… Brother's right.\NI really do…think ill of him… Excellence is not easy at all. If you have power,\Nyou become alienated and also arrogant. Even if you’re coveted\Nand sought after at first. But, we only have each other\Nfor siblings. I will continue to exist with you\Nas a wall you must get over… Even if I’m ill-thought of…\NThat’s what a big brother is. Is Itachi home?! I have something to\Ntalk to you about. Come out! Why’s everyone gathered here? There are two people who didn’t come\Nto yesterday’s assembly. Why didn’t you come?! He didn’t go to the assembly Father\Nwas talking about last night, after all. I understand that when you enter Anbu, you get roped into various\Ntroublesome things. Your father also said something\Nlike that in your defense. But for us, we don’t intend\Nto treat you special. Understood. I shall be careful next time. Now I’m going to have\Nto ask you to leave. Right… But before that,\Nthere’s a little more I want to ask you… It’s about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself\Ninto the Nakano River to kill himself. Threw himself?! The other person who didn’t come\Nto the assembly is that Shisui. As I recall, you adored him\Nlike a real older brother. I see… I hadn’t seen him at all recently. That’s too bad. And we the Police Force have decided\Nto launch an all-out investigation. Investigation?! This is the will Shisui wrote. The analysis of the handwriting\Nhas been completed. No mistake, he did indeed write it. If there are no murder leads,\Nthen what’s the investigation? It’d be easy for a person who can use\NSharingan to copy handwriting, you see… The most adept Uchiha. The man feared as Shisui,\N“the Instantaneous Man.” He was a man who would take\Nthe lead no matter what the mission if it was for the sake of the clan. It’s tough to think that such a man would leave something\Nlike this and kill himself. You shouldn’t judge people…\Nonly on looks and speculation. For the time being,\NI leave the will with you. Take that and you request cooperation\Nin the investigation from Anbu Black Ops. Understood… I hope we get a lead. Also, we have a different route\Nto Anbu Black Ops. We’ll know right away if you do something\Nlike crushing the investigation request. Why don’t you just come right out\Nand say it? You suspect me, right? Yeah. That’s right, you little punk… Listen up, Itachi. Just try doing something\Nlike betraying the clan and… it’ll cost you! I told you before. You shouldn’t judge people…\Nonly on looks and speculation. It’s because you take the liberty to\Njudge me as patient and take me lightly. Clan…Clan… You measure incorrectly\Nthe size of your own vessels and don’t know the depth of mine,\Nso you grovel there… I’ve never seen him like this… Shisui…was monitoring you recently… Half a year after entering Anbu… the strangeness of your behavior\Ncouldn’t be overlooked. What the hell are you thinking? Fixated on the organization, fixated on the clan,\Nfixated on the name. It’s a dreadful thing that constrains oneself\Nand labels one’s own vessel. And it’s a foolish thing… that fear and hate…\Nwhat one has never seen or known… Stop, Itachi! What the hell’s the matter\Nwith you?! Itachi…\NYou’ve been a little strange lately. I’m not strange at all. I’m carrying out my own role…\NThat’s it. Then why didn’t you come last night? In order to elevate myself higher… What’re you talking about…? My vessel is dismayed\Nat this foolish clan! From olden times,\Nthe Uchiha Clan has all along been in charge protecting\Nthe peace of this village. The Uchiha crest is a testament\Nto the proud clan. That’s my boy… I’ve great confidence\Nyou’ll do great in Anbu Black Ops. Because you're fixated\Non insignificant things like clans… you lose sight of what’s truly important. True change cannot be made if stuck\Nwithin the restrictions of regulations, and constrained predictions\Nand imagination… Saying such arrogant things! Enough! You’ll be imprisoned\Nif you say any more foolish nonsense. Excellence is not easy at all. If you have power,\Nyou become alienated and also arrogant… even if you’re coveted\Nand sought after at first… Why… Big Brother…? What do you say?! I can’t tolerate it anymore…\NCaptain, order imprisonment! Big Brother! Stop it already! I’m not the one who killed Shisui. But I apologize for\Nmy numerous slips of the tongue. I’m very sorry… Recently, it seems he’s been up\Nto his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions and was a little tired… Captain! The Anbu Black Ops is a force\Nunder the direct control of Lord Hokage… Even we the Police Force can’t arrest him,\Nif we don’t have an arrest warrant. And as for Itachi… I will take the responsibility\Nand monitor him. Please… Understood… With this, you’ve woken up, right? We had a hindrance back at that time… But it won’t be like that this time. I’ll show you…\Nthe true power of Sharingan. When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… Give me all you've got,\NNaruto. Or is this all you've got? You were talking impudently\Nabout your Way of Ninja and this is all you've got? You've gotta be kidding! Right now,\Nyou're not even worth beating!

105,"Connecting old words\Nthat have been used up I just want to convey\Nmy simple thoughts That day's faint wind blows away at the castle ruins of yesterday I'll laugh with  you\Nand live for the moment Still that incident\Nwill continue to trouble you, right? That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away Okay! Drink! Sing! Let's have fun! Good grief…This is too much for…\Na pre-celebration. Did you take care of the business? Yes… More importantly,\Nthe rain’s starting to let up. Shouldn’t you quickly put an end\Nto this farce of a race? Fine. Guess I’ll go for a run! A-Above here, huh? Yeah… It’s a quite a long staircase,\Nbelieve it. They’re also called\Nthe Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart. Heh, cool! Let’s go at a sprint! Hey, he’s kidding, right? What kind of stamina does he have? Boss. It seems Idate is heading this way! He hasn’t run away,\Njust like you said, Boss. Of course… I saw potential in him. Now, it’s just a little more!\NRun Idate! A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder Hey…you…! Huh? Let me tell you… It’s not like I trust you\Nor anything yet, okay? Yeah, yeah whatever. It doesn’t really matter to me,\Nbelieve it. There’s a person\Nwho still trusts you, right?! During the Chunin Exam… Huh? You said that a tenth problem\Nappeared, right? Yeah. It was a weird problem to determine\Nwhether you’d take the problem or not. Three years ago… I got a similar problem… Okay, now I’m going to\Ngive the tenth problem. The tenth problem… What kind of problem is\NBig Brother going to give?! The tenth problem is a battle with the Three-Man Squad\Nyou were teamed up with. The three of you will compete against\Neach other this exercise. And among you…\None of you will be failed! And the one who is failed\Nwill remain a Genin for life and we will never again\Nlet them take the Chunin Exam! N-No way… Then for what purpose\Nwere we together until now? I make the rules here. Back-talk is not allowed at all! If you want to withdraw,\Nyou should do so. Withdrawing here and\Nwaiting half a year is also a way. If one person among\Nthe three withdraws, of course all three members\Nwill be disqualified. But you will be allowed\Nto take the Chunin Exam one more time, in half a year. So, what will you do? One comrade will be dropped. I have the confidence to pass. But, one of them will remain\Na Genin for life. It’s a choice between\Ncomrades and your life. If you’re going to quit,\Nnow’s the time. Is there nobody else\Nwho’s going to withdraw? We’re good, then. Okay, to everyone who\Nhas remained here… I render you disqualified! Wh-Why…? H-Hold on a minute! I prepared myself and remained here! Such preparedness is below contempt! Scums like you don’t have\Nthe qualifications to become Chunin! That’s all! I see… What kind of a test was it\Nfor you guys? I forgot… I mean, it was explained to me,\Nbut I didn’t really get it. Trusting in my big brother’s words,\NI remained in the classroom. And yet I was failed! No way could I take that.\NI questioned my big brother. Big Brother!\NWhat’s up with that test?! A Shinobi reads the double bluff. You should’ve understood\Nthat was the test. Even so, I can’t accept that! No matter how dangerous, isn’t it necessary to have\Nthe courage to plunge into any mission?! Idate. Can you really not accept it? Of course not, such a… You…quit as a Ninja. If you’re telling me to quit,\Nthen I will. But tell me why I’m no good! That’s something you should\Nrealize yourself, with your own power. To this day…I don’t understand\Nthe answer to that. So after that,\Nyou were deceived by Aoi, huh? Yeah, that’s right. We made it…to the top! I’m going by myself from here.\NYou rest! Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?! I can’t be asking you guys\Nto help any more. There’s no point if I don’t win by myself,\Non my own strength! Oh…hey! Idate! I can make it! It seems\NSakura’s special medicine has worked! Blast! This doesn’t hurt! I’m back in the game…\Nfrom here! If we cross this suspension bridge,\Nit’s Ouzu Island, huh? We should hurry. It seems Idate has made it\Nto the Modoroki Shrine. What?! It seems we underestimated\Nthe Leaf Genin a bit… You jerk!\NYou didn’t finish them?! Now’s not the time to be talking\Nabout stuff like that. Please cross the bridge quickly! Useless Ninja! Hey! I’m only helping you\Nbecause it’s the job. I’ll waste you if you keep\Ntalking smart to me. I-I’m sorry… If you’ve understood,\Nthen get a move on! Y-Yes! There he is! That Fukusuke jerk! This is quite something. I never thought\Nyou’d make it this far. That’s the…\NBlade of the Thunder God! Stop! Stop! Stop kicking a dead horse. Nobody is a match for\Nthe legendary Blade of the Thunder God, said to have been used\Nby the Second Hokage. You should know this well. After all, you’re the man\Nwho stole this for me. Blast… Mud balls, huh?\Nlt’s just like a kid’s fight. Sorry, I didn’t have\Nany Kunai Knives. Naruto… But you won’t be able to dodge\Nthe next ball just with that. Shadow Clone Jutsu! He’s concentrating\Nthe Chakra in his palm. Here I come! Here I come! Once more! I don’t know what\Nyou intend to do, but… Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm! Too bad. This Blade of the Thunder God\Ncuts through anything! Even Chakra itself is no exception. Naruto! I have to make doubly sure so that nothing troublesome\Nwill happen again. I’m your opponent!\NKeep your hands off Idate! Humph, are you still\Nsaying such things? Saving each other, protecting each other,\Ntrusting each other. It ticks me off! The weak can't survive\Nif they don’t support each other. So they trust people easily\Nand are betrayed. Weaklings like you guys\Nshould just run about and away. Right, Idate? It was like that also\Nwhen you stole this Blade of the Thunder God, right? I can see it.\NThat’s the Village Hidden in the Rain. Aoi Sensei?! Aoi Sensei! Idate… B-Big Brother… You idiot! Go back to the village immediately\Nand surrender yourself! You?! Do you know what\Nyou have done? What?! Strict as always, eh?\NAnd he’s your cute little brother. But it’s truly perfect that\Nyou’ve shown up here. Aoi Sensei… This forbidden Jutsu scroll\Ncan’t be deciphered unless you’re Jonin class. I’ll have the brothers\Nbetray the Leaf Village together. Ibiki, please decipher it already. I refuse. So are you choosing death,\Ntogether with Idate? Such as he is,\Nhe’s also a Shinobi. He’s not afraid of death. It doesn’t seem so. This face is one taut with fear. I’m quitting as a Ninja!\NSo please don’t kill me! Please decipher it. You don’t want to see\Nyour cute little brother killed before your eyes, do you? Little brother, you say? That fool? Big Brother… Such a threat means nothing to me. Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves that important? Even if you protect it at\Nthe risk of your own life, you’re nothing but a pawn! So that’s why\Nyou became a traitor? You’re a pathetic man! You punk! Idate! You, run away! What about you, Big Brother? I’ll go, after I clean up\Nthe mess here! I don’t think so! Big Brother! Go, quickly! But Big Brother…! Go! Having you stay is a burden! I won’t let you! Go! So appalling… that he’d risk\Nhis life for such an idiotic guy. All you could do after that\Nwas run. You could’ve returned\Nto the village and called for help. But you didn’t do that. Thinking Ibiki was dead\Nwas no excuse! The fact is, he was alive… In that regard,\Nlbiki was admirable. Not only did he completely endure\Nrepeated interrogation, but he also retrieved\Nthe Forbidden Jutsu scroll... without having confessed to anything! And to think that he did\Nall this for his good-for-nothing little brother. You betrayed your village,\Nabandoned your older brother, and came to think of only yourself. Even Ibiki who is blood-related\Nand risked his life to save you, you didn’t trust him! Afraid of being accused, you didn’t trust the Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves, your birthplace… You trust nobody. You’re not trusted by anyone. For me, there is no pupil\Nas excellent as you. As a reward,\NI’ll let you die in one instant. Idate! Sasuke…Sakura! Rest, Naruto! I’ll beat this guy! Don’t be acting cool, believe it. You can’t beat me, no matter\Nhow many people show up. Me, Aoi Rokusho, the Rain Jonin who possesses\Nthe Blade of the Thunder God. Is that so? Interesting. The Blade of the Thunder God\Nand my Chidori! Let’s test which is better! The rumors were true. The survivor of the village’s honorable\NUchiha Clan… is just a good-for-nothing kid… Sasuke! Run, Sakura! He’ll show no mercy,\Nno matter who the person is. Everyone will be killed! No way! Huh?! We’ll protect you,\Nno matter what. We promised that, didn’t we?! Trust us! Now all that’s left is\Nthe wounded rabbit and the excellent pupil, huh? You two together,\Ngo to the next world. Take it back! Take it back! What’re you talking about? What you said… earlier! Don't mess… with the Uchiha…\N276	02:10:08:14	02:10:10:02\Nwith me! Why you--! Sasuke! Sasuke! Get up! How very cold the bottom\Nof the ocean must be. Stop! Idate! Sakura! Sakura!

Even if you change to\Nwho you really wanna be Will you always have a great smile? Dreaming of only “the beginning,”\NI wake up and someday, I'll live on my own. Yes, precious things are never in shape You never know what it is\Nwhen you get it or lose it Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,\Nyour uniqueness into strength Even if you get lost,\Nlet's start walking One more time Naruto…! He came in totally late. Hmm? Where’s Sasuke? The Dosu guy I’m supposed\Nto fight isn’t here, either. Hey, you guys over there. Throw out your chests and\Nshow your faces to the spectators! You guys are the stars\Nof this “final round”! Sasuke hasn’t been found yet? A team of several Anbu members\Nare searching all over, but they have found nothing. He might already be in\Nthe hands of Orochimaru… If that’s the case,\Nwe may never find him. I understand. Well-well… Lord Kazekage. You must be tired having\Ncome all this way. No…I’m glad the arena\Nis in the Leaf Village. Even though you’re still young, it would\Nprobably be a tough journey for you if you had to go to the trouble\Nof traveling someplace else. Shouldn’t you decide on\Nthe Fifth Hokage soon? Please don’t treat me\Nlike an old person. I’m still planning on\Nbeing Hokage for another five years… Now then, I guess it’s\Nabout time to begin. Everyone, thank you very much\Nfor coming to the Village Hidden in Leaves\NChunin Exam. We will now begin the\N“final round” matches for the eight who made it\Nthrough the preliminaries! Please watch until the end! If there are supposed to be eight,\Nit looks like there’s one missing. I have something to tell\Nyou before the match. Look at this. Huh?! There was a slight change\Nto the tournament. Check who you’ll be facing\None more time. Here, I had more preliminary\Nmatches than the others… So the Dosu guy dropped out? I thought I’d pound you here… If I did that,\Nthere’d be the possibility for me, as the one remaining after\Nthe first battle, to fight Sasuke. W-What are you?! Say… …say. What? Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come. What’ll happen? I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out\Nof the hospital room at that time. Something could’ve happened to him… In case a competitor does not arrive\Nby the start time of his match… he or she will lose by default! It doesn’t make sense. Knowing his character,\Nhe’d come even if he had to drag himself. Where are you going, Gaara? To verify my existence…\None more time. One more time. What’s wrong?\NYou should still be able to move, right?! Sasuke! Come on! Could it be…? Even after I warned him to avoid\Ndoing anything to stand out… He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchiha\Nalso, did he…? Listen up, you guys. The terrain is different,\Nbut the rule is that there are no rules, the same as\Nin the preliminaries. The matches will continue until one\Nor the other dies, or acknowledges defeat. However, if I judge that it has been settled,\NI’ll stop the match there. Arguments will not be allowed. Understood? So the first match is… Naruto Uzumaki. Neji Hyuga. Just those two remain and\Nthe rest of you go to the waiting room. Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone! Hey, Hinata! These seats are open. Uh-huh. This match will be quite interesting! Naruto… Say, Sakura. I understand that you’re worried\Nabout Sasuke. But why don’t you cheer\Nfor Naruto at least a little bit? Hmm. You’re right. That being said, with Neji as his opponent,\NNaruto has no chance of winning. That is…! Not so, is what you’re\Ngoing to say? But to think that brat would\Nsurvive until this point… I wonder if this is\Nas far as it goes for those who survived\Njust by luck, after all. That Naruto. This is not a good opponent at all. No matter how you look at it,\Nhe can’t beat the Hyuga clan. Well, that’s what I thought\Nat the beginning… But you’ll all be surprised\Nif you underestimate him. Akamaru, what’s wrong? What did you say?! What?! Where?! There! What’s Anbu, the Black Ops,\Ndoing here? Is something going on…? You seem like you want\Nto say something. I said it before, too, didn’t I? A failure is a failure.\NYou can’t change. I promise … I’ll win, no matter what! He has the look…\Nof being sure of himself… It’s as if he’s not all worked up… That makes it\Nmore worthwhile for me. I look forward to your look\Nof disappointment… when you know the true reality… Stop whining. Let’s…get started! Now then, round one. Begin! Watch carefully, Hanabi. Nobody has inherited such\Na strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai. To say nothing of your older sister. More than big sister? Perhaps more than you, too. This time, it’s not an opponent\Nthat can be managed easily. He has that Byakugan. Close combat is no good… Does Naruto know that? Idiot! Why would anyone\Nattack from the front?! No! Naruto. The opponent can see\Nyour Chakra Points! They're called Chakra Points. If those pressure points\Nare pressed accurately… the flow of an opponent’s Chakra\Ncan be stopped, amplified or controlled at will. Uh-oh! I missed, huh…? In other words, he’ll press\Nthe pressure point if I get too close and I’ll become unable\Nto use Jutsu. That means all I can do\Nis fight from a distance. You understand, right?\NYou have no way of winning. Heh… All I did was to verify your power. The real fight is just getting started! Shadow Clone Jutsu! You used your head,\Ndidn’t you, Naruto?! With the Shadow Clone Jutsu… Heh. He’s an interesting kid. Shadow Clone Jutsu is\Na Jonin level technique. To think he could use\Nsuch an Jutsu… Who knows how this’ll turn out? Shadow Clone Jutsu?! I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed\Namong the clones, indeed, I can’t detect the\Nreal one even with my Byakugan. But there’s only one real one,\Nafter all! Heh. Don’t be acting tough! If you’re going to come,\Nthen come. It’s pointless. In front of that Neji’s defense,\Nit’s not just all attacking. Hey! Don’t…you…underestimate… …me! Here they come! He hit! Fool. Wha--?! Dang it! I’ll get you next time! Here! This guy… Does he have eyes behind him…? You’re going to become…\Nthe Hokage…? With this level, it’s impossible. I can generally tell\Nwith these eyes… Intrinsic abilities are set. Figuratively speaking,\Neverything inherent about people is set. Why…? Why are you always so\Njudgmental like that? Then…are you going to say\Nthat anybody can become the Hokage… if they just work hard? Only a very small percentage of\NShinobi are chosen to be the Hokage! Look more at reality! Those who become the Hokage\Nare born with a destiny. It’s not something you become\Nby trying to become it. It’s determined by destiny. People must live within\Ntheir different respective currents that can’t be defied. The one single…\Ndestiny everyone has equally… ...is death. Those eyes… He still holds a grudge\Nagainst the head family, huh? So… So what?! I don’t know when to give up!\NShadow Clone Jutsu! One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two!

What?! O-Oh! T-That’s… It's the empty shell of sand! Lee's Hidden Strength:\NForbidden Secret Jutsu! When did that…?! That’s not possible! While you had your eyes closed\Nand were praying. What? For a moment, Lee stopped moving\Nbecause of the pain in his body. At that moment…that’s when! Gaara! That's...! There’s no doubt about it – his eyes… He’s completely awake… The demon…inside him. Run away! That Bowl-Cut’s totally worn down… Gaara is toying with him. W-Why doesn’t Lee dodge? With Lee’s speed, he should easily be\Nable to dodge that level of attack. It’s not that he doesn’t dodge,\Nit’s that he can’t dodge. What?! What do you mean? The Lotus is a double-edged sword. What do you mean double-edged sword? Why do you think the Lotus is\Na forbidden technique? Well… The Lotus isn’t a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu. It’s a Taijutsu, with that much\Nhigh-speed movement. The load it puts on a person’s body\Nis beyond imagination. So Lee’s entire body is in\Nso much pain right now that even moving is out of the question. Isn’t that so… Guy? But that’s…! He has no Ninjutsu, not even\None Genjutsu … Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on, it’s now even less than\Nan average person’s … There’s no way he can win! He’s had it if this goes on… Lee… Hey, get a move on all of you. I’ll add another 200 laps! Stupid! There’s no way\Nyou’ll become a Ninja. Yes, I will. There’s no way a chump who can’t\Neven use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja! Yes, I will! Whatever, but the fact that a guy like\Nyou without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu and with less Taijutsu than\Nan average person is in this Ninja academy is nonsense. Do you know what you’re called here? Hot-Blooded! Hot-Blooded! Hot-Blooded lose- Hey, get in line, Lee! Hey Lee! So that’s the hot-blooded loser\Neveryone’s talking about. Doesn’t he look like\Nsomeone we know? Huh? In particular…his eyebrows. Hmm… Rock Lee… The chump who can only perform\Nless than average Taijutsu… But you... You practiced your less\Nthan average Taijutsu … You practiced it over and\Nover again like crazy… 396…397…398…399… 400…401…402…403… If I can’t do a log kick 500 times,\Nthen it’s 1,000 squats! 413... 414... 415... 416... 417... 418...! 419... 420… So someone’s here before me… 422… 423... 424... 425... 426... I suppose I’ll come back… If I can’t do 1,000 squats,\Nthen it’s 2,000 punches! 795… 796… 797… 798… He’s still at it…! 2,000 punches! If I can’t, it’s 2,000 jump ropes! You recklessly practiced only\NTaijutsu and eventually… All right, you’ve all become\NGenin as of today, so I’d like to know what\Nit is you’re all aiming for! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Tenten. I’d like to become a powerful Ninja\Nlike the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade! Hmm... And, how about you, Neji? I don’t want to answer… I…! I’d like to prove that I could\Nbecome a respectable Ninja even though I can’t use\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu! That would be the ultimate for me! Those are good serious eyes… Humph! You! What’s so funny?! I’m serious! I will become a respectable Ninja\Neven only with Taijutsu! He should give up already… At this rate… He will simply die with Gaara\Njust toying with him… Bushy Brows…! Lee… Not yet… Not yet! Lee, you just won’t learn\Nyour lesson, will you? There’s no way you can win… Unlike you, Neji is a genius. A genius…? What is a genius?! Even though I may not have talent,\NI’ll exceed genius with my efforts. That is my entire being! That is my Way of the Ninja! You’ll get nowhere, Lee… No matter how much effort you make, there’s no way you can take me down. That’s simply a fact. That's not true! That’s not… But you…refused to give up, not ever! Such meaningless actions… The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to\Nhave Gaara as his opponent! No… Lee’s not one to give up\Nwith this much. – What? 					– Huh? The reason is that Lee… The reason is that Lee… You…continued to make effort. If I can’t jump rope 1,200 times,\NI’ll log kick 2,000 times! 1,116... 1,117...! 1,118... 1,11--! Huh?! Lee! Are you taking a break already? Guy Sensei… What is it that you want? If it’s about my blunder with\Nthe recent assignment, I believe I’ve apologized. Lee… It’s true you’re different from Neji. You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,\Nand you’re not a Taijutsu genius either… But Lee... you have powers\Nthat exceed Neji… you’re a genius with hidden potential. If you’re trying to make me feel better,\Nplease stop! Idiot! I’m not trying to make you feel better\Nor anything! The reason is that you are… a genius of effort! I wonder if… If that’s true…? I've…I’ve believed that to be true… That if I trained harder than Neji…\N2 or 3 times as much… that I’d surely become stronger. But... I’ve recently begun to think that… I can’t beat a real genius. Is effort really rewarded…? I’ve wanted to know this and so I’ve taken on Neji,\Nbut it’s always been the same…! I’m no match for him at all! Even when I’m on a mission… My legs still tremble even now… I think that I’ll never become\Nstronger though I strive and strive… I am so afraid that I can’t bear it! What am I to do…? There’s no point in making the effort\Nif you don’t believe in yourself! Lee, you’re very similar to me. Do you mean our eyebrows? No, not just our eyebrows… I was actually a failure once too… You were, Sensei? But now, I can even win against\Nthe genius elite Kakashi, because of my efforts… “I’d like to prove that I can become\Na respectable Ninja even though I can’t use Ninjutsu\Nand Genjutsu” you said. That’s your Ninja way, right? That’s a fine goal… It’s a fine goal worth sticking to! That’s why you should believe in\Nyour path and forge straight ahead! Become a man powerful enough\Nso that I can just watch you smiling! Understand, Lee?! Yes! Thank you…Guy Sensei…! Stop, Lee! If you fight any more, you’ll die! Bushy Brows… What?! Movement has... ...returned to Lee! Sensei is smiling and watching me… And just because of that,\NI can come back stronger! Stronger… stronger still! Lee’s smiling…even though\Nhe’s been driven into corner. No. It’s his turn to do the driving. Huh? The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice. Blossoms twice…? Lee said that too! The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice. When we meet the next time,\NI vow that I will be an even stronger man. No, Guy! You haven’t?! It’s exactly as you imagine. So that Genin… that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates\Nin his body and use the Hidden Lotus… The Hidden Lotus? That’s right … This is incredible… Guy… How many of the Eight Inner Gates\Ncan that boy open now…? Five gates. What exactly is it? These Eight Inner Gates and\Nthat Hidden Lotus? The Eight Inner Gates are\N“Limiter Releases” used in preparations for\Nreaching the Hidden Lotus. A “Limiter Releases”? That’s right … In the Chakra Network\Nwhere chakra flows, there are eight places where the\Nchakra points are concentrated in each area of the body from the\Nhead area down-- the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,\NGate of Life, Gate of Pain, Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,\NGate of Shock and Gate of Death. These are called the Eight Inner Gates. These eight gates\Ncontinually “limit” the amount of Chakra flowing\Nthrough the body… However, the Lotus’s essence is to force\Nthe boundaries of these “limits” to open… and bring out several\Ntens of times the body’s strength. The Primary Lotus… opens only the first gate,\Nthe Gate of Opening, and releases the brains restraints to bring forth a person’s muscles’ strength\Nto its fullest! That’s the kind of technique it is. So…what is the Hidden Lotus? After forcing the stamina to increase\Nat the second gate, the Gate of Rest… From the third gate, the Gate of Life,\None enters the Hidden Lotus! No way! Even after using just the Primary Lotus,\Nhis body was in shambles. So if he uses a technique beyond that… That’s right. Huh? By opening all the 8 gates, one attains strength exceeding\Neven the Hokage, but in return… one dies! I don’t intend to pry into what that\Nboy means to you or to tell you not to bring\Nyour personal feelings into play… But there is a limit! I’ve misjudged you…Guy! What do you know…about that boy?!

36,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. I’ve…had it… Oh, Sakura! For crying out loud,\Nhow far have we walked? The tower hasn’t gotten a bit closer. Here we can see it\Nright in front of our eyes. Strange… No mistake about it. It seems that we’re already within\Nthe enthusiastic welcome. Take a look at that. Huh? Oh, that can’t be! What on earth is going on?! No way! Is it Genjutsu…? So it seems.\NWe were lured in perfectly. It appears we were meticulously careful, and were made to walk\Naround the same place in a circle. We’re being watched… Probably. They intend to wear down\Nour physical strength and catch us unprepared when\N we’re bone-tired. If so, then this follows the enemy strategy. Then.... They’ll be coming soon. Humph, they’ve appeared. This is the perfect handicap.\N Believe it! Clone vs. Clone:\NMine are Better than Yours! W-What is this? It’s quite a number. Moreover, they’re clones? Cornered rats. Shut up! Oh, they’re quite weak, huh? Good! Naruto! W-What are these guys? W-What’s going on here? I’ll assess this! Sharingan! Naruto! Sasuke! Sasuke! W-What’s going on? My body’s… Are you okay? No mistake. It’s the real thing, not an illusion. – Scroll please.\N– Scroll please. That Kabuto was injured means\Nthese things are actual Shadow Clones?! B-But... even though Shadow clones\Nare supposed to vanish if they take a direct attack,\Nthese things don't vanish. Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?! Which is it?! Scroll please. Scroll please. Give me scroll. Dang it! It’s futile! Stop! These things are illusions. It’s an enemy Genjutsu. B-But, Kabuto’s wound is the real thing. No, it’s as Sasuke says. Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere… and coordinating their attack with\Nmovements of the “Genjutsu Shinobis” and attacking from a different location. Pretending as if those\NGenjutsu Shinobis are attacking. – Scroll please.\N– Scroll please. Then I’ll find the idiot who’s behind\Nthe scenes throwing Kunai knives\Nand kick his butt, believe it! Hold it, Naruto. We’ve been deceived as\Nto the source of the Kunai knives… so we can’t discover the precise\Nlocation of the enemy like this. Do you get it? That is the enemy’s purpose. From a data standpoint, it’s a type\Nwho is weak at close combat and Taijutsu that likes\Nthis kind of attack.\N95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29\N							The true enemy won’t come out\N		until we can’t move at all. Listen, everyone! In any case, all there is to do now is to fend\Noff the enemy attack. Fine, if that’s what their plan is… Now then…\NI wonder how far they can hold out. The night is long. Man! 					This is endless! Since it’s come to this…! Stop! Naruto, don’t waste your Chakra! Even if you attack these things,\Nthere’s no point! If I hit them all in\Na single sweep, the enemy won’t fire inadvertently\Nwhile these things are reverting back. The hiding place will\Nbe discovered, so. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clones?! It’s not over yet! Sasuke, what should we do…? Man, that loser.\NAll there is to do is go for it! B-But… Indeed… It’s not a situation that\Nhe can get through by himself. Let’s go, Sakura! Y-Yeah! I’m not finished yet… Dawn is breaking. It’s finally time for the hunt. Mubi, that’s enough. We’re finished hunting their spirits. Now what’s left is just their bodies. Lucky. You’re…the one who…\Ndid my left shoulder. I finally found you. You really hung me up. Lucky. I can finally even the score. You…really hung me up. Lucky. I can finally even the score. Heh! Cornered rats. It went well, Naruto! W-What the heck\Nare these guys?! T-This can’t be! Since when…?! Idiot! You finally showed your\Ntrue colors, punk! T-This brat, don’t tell me… The Shadow Clone is just\Nthe preparation for the trick... for me to portray every member\Nof the team by myself! At the same time Naruto\Nlifted the Shadow Clone, the three of us hid. The Genjutsu users were\Nadversely deceived. Naruto! Naruto, you’ve used too much Chakra. I’ll do the rest. No way! I’m not always going to have\Nthe good parts taken away! Is this really that Naruto…? Since when had he improved\Nthis much? That’s some brat… I can’t believe he can still move. Naruto… Amazing Chakra stamina… Right after\Na Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu… a daring technique that transforms just\Nthree of the bodies into his companions. To think he can still move\Neven after doing all that. Here it’s the fifth day now. This kid will transform if he can just master\Nthe use of his Chakra. Not bad. But we’re still not unlucky. There’s no time. This time around,\Nwe’ll show you our Ninjutsu! Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu! Shadow clones? No, they are plain clones. However, he's up to something. Be careful! Hah! If they are just clones,\Nthen there’s one real body. I’ll kick their butts right\Nand left until I run into him. You idiot. Such a tactless thing… I’m telling you! I’m saying don’t stick your nose in! Naruto! That’s reckless! Cripes! From earlier, the nape of my neck\Nhurts when I use the Sharingan. Maybe I used too much Chakra. Dang it! Dang it. A clone?! This one, too?! This one, too?! This one, too?! Naruto! Stop! Are they all fakes?! Or could it be Genjutsu again?! This is… the last…Chakra. Sharingan! Sasuke! The bruise again… Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke! It won’t do to create an opening! Kabuto! Darn it! Stop! Naruto! No matter how much\Nyou swing at them, the real body isn’t in those clones. Then where’s the enemy\Nattacking us from?! If they are merely clones,\Nthe clones themselves can’t attack! If I knew that, we wouldn’t be\Nhaving a rough time of it! This is the enemy’s scheme. Man, I can’t use\Nthe Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore… They’ve about reached their limit. Lucky. That’s it! The real body hides with\Nthe Earth Style Jutsu and attacks from behind a clone! Kabuto! Heh, “it won’t do to\Ncreate an opening,” right?! Thank you, Naruto.\NYou saved me. We're okay here, Naruto! What happened there?  Are you hurt? That’s a terrible bruise. It’s nothing. Here it is, here it is! Look, the Heaven scroll! Good for you. There’s something about this guy...\Nthat I don’t like. Oh, it’s you guys. You’re late, Kabuto. I got a bit involved in something. Sorry. But, but…\Nthanks to you, we got both the scrolls. No, it’s because you guys fought hard. You were amazing\Nat the end, Naruto. We’re going through this door. Well then, I wish us both luck. Yeah! Yeah! What of the harvest? Yes. More than I expected. I filled in his entire data\Nfrom this second exam. You need this, right? So, how was it? Sure enough, it appears you’re curious. Master Orochimaru. I want to ask your opinion. As a Sound Village’s spy… That’s not necessary, is it? You will be the one to decide it all, so… I like that cleverness of yours. Good work. There’s nobody here. I’m okay now, Sakura. O-Okay. That’s too bad! Cha! Say-say, what’re we supposed to do? Oh! Look at that… Without… Heaven…\NI don’t get it at all. If “Heaven” does not exist, enrich your knowledge,\Nand prepare for the chance. If “Earth” does not exist, run the fields in search\Nof an advantage. Open the series of\NHeaven and Earth, and the perilous way\Nshall be redressed… This is namely the secret of\N“the one that guides…” What’s that? It looks like there are letters\Nor something missing there. It’s probably has to do with the scroll. I think this means we’re supposed\Nto open the Heaven & Earth scroll. Okay then, I’m going to open it. Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

I see… It was you, huh?! The nerve of you to mess with me! Stop it, get away! Don’t turn your back to the enemy…! You forgot the ironclad rule\Nof the fight… You lose! You saved me… That brat hit me with all his strength… And that Yoroi is no good either. I caught a huge fish! You mean you’re going\Nto escape alone?

Of your numerous crimes… When we return to the village\Njustice will be served, and it won’t be quick,\Nso prepare yourself. It’s not over yet… You! I haven’t hit you enough yet! That’s too bad. What?! What…What’s going on? The Sea Monster doesn’t die.\Nlt is immortal, that one! For the Sea Monster,\Nthis limitless seawater is its life… In the end, it will be your loss! Shut up!

Hot, hot! You got no business getting\Nso motivated all by yourself! It itches, itches and\NI’m getting a rash all over my body! Wait, wait.\NDon’t come over here, Naruto!

Please don’t let something like\Nthe saltwater bother you and fight. Humph! You can’t even control\Nthe summoned animal you called up! What was that?! If you don’t send him home quickly the Sea Monster will gulp him down\Nand he’ll whither like a slug! A slug, he says?! Hey, Naruto! I’m going to\Nkick your butt later… Right now, I’ll help you. Huh? F-For real?! Don’t mess with amphibians… I’ll show you my terror! Yeah! Now you're talking. Hang on! Wh-What the…? You rat… Let go of me, huh! What is this? He got you, Chief Toad! You be quiet! Upsy! This isn’t accomplishing anything… What’s up with\Nthat flabby bastard, really? In short, this is some kind of monster consisting of water gathered around\Nits spiritual body at the core. Crap! I don’t really know what that means, but I guess I can’t do anything\Nabout that thing. Even though we pierce the monster\Nwith a dagger all we want, the monster will suck up ocean water\Nand come back to life… Then what should we do,\NChief Toad?! The only thing we can do here is to somehow damage\Nthe spiritual body at the “core.” Damage…? How? The opponent is a clump of water… Add heat and he’ll evaporate! The thoughts of fools mean nothing… The only thing you can do is to\Nsurrender to me, I who control the ocean! Damn. You’re annoying.\NLet’s go, Naruto! What? Go? Where are you going?! Airhead!

Wait! No use talking! It itches. I can’t take it! Something like this doesn’t\Nsoothe my feelings but, my sons have caused you inconvenience,\Nso I forgive you this time. See you! I’m sorry, Chief Toad… Help me… Now that we also got rid of\Nthe Sea Monster, Amachi… You’ll be taken to\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves as the principle offender of\Nthe attacks on ships collecting funds.

Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands The distance created between us\Nbecame too big, because we were always together Your honest reply, “See you…” coming from that brash mouth\Nmakes it sadder.

What’s going on\Nwith our pursuers? Yeah, we went to the trouble of\Nleaving footprints as we go. We need them to follow. It’ll be okay. They’ll be within\Nfiring range immediately! There are three pursuers.\NOne of them is Gaara! As for the extra two, we'll leave one\Nfor each respectively and deal with them with\NOne Shinobi, One Kill… I’ll isolate Gaara and drive him into\Nthe Reverse Scale Position. I’ll take the first person. All right, go. It's not necessary to drive him\Ninto the Reverse Scale Position. There are only three of them.\NI can handle them by myself. Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword: Whirlwind! What?! What is this? A wind user, huh? Interesting! – Splendid.\N– Not bad, Temari. Naturally. Not half bad. To think you’d blow away my Whirlwind. What, you’re still just a kid? – You guys go on ahead.\N– What? Hey, Temari. You okay with this? Will you be okay? Well, we’re fellow wind users. I should be able to handle her alone. Hurry, Gaara. She’s your student, right? Thanks. – I’m counting on you.\N– Be careful. Right. You won’t get away. I’m your opponent. Cyclone Scythe Jutsu. Wind Slash. This wind is… These double swords alter the wind\Nat my will to suit the attacks and amplify the power to the extreme. It’s too late to regret.

This is the Dragon Eye:\NFang Release: Dark Sword. You’re just a kid! I see. It’s an adjustable sword with daggers connected by an iron wire\Ngoing through the center. Like a Bamboo Snake?\NHow nostalgic. I used one a lot with puppet games\Nwhen I was a kid. It can look like a living snake\Ndepending on how it’s controlled. But there’s no point\Nonce it’s been identified. Though we both use Puppets,\Ncompared to mine, it’s just a kid’s toy. Go, Gaara. Can I leave it to you? Yeah. I don’t need your help for this.\NI’ll catch up right away. I’m counting on you. Now, bring it on. I’ll play with you. What’re you doing acting tough? You’ll die if you take me lightly! That goes for you! Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk! Here I go. That’s no good. Come on, that was too easy. Too bad. This sword\Nisn’t just an adjustable sword. The sword itself amplifies Chakra\Nin response to my Chakra and changes into the form of a dragon. Gaara, I’m sorry.\NThis might take a little time. Suiko, you ambush him here. Draw him into\Nthe Reverse Scale Position. Got it? Yeah… You won’t get through here. Gaara, fight me. Very well. Bring it. Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we\Ngoing to stay like this? Shut up. There are many difficulties\Nwith ambushes. Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata\Nare taking on those difficulties for us. What? They are? Did you find them? Byakugan! In that direction, right? Byakugan! Got it. There are three battle areas. It’s the scent bag of\Nthe female Parasitic Insects. With this, the insects will find you\Nno matter where you go. Right. I’m counting on you, Shino.

If the guys who are fleeing will take on\Npursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill, the battle area not being\Na straight line means… Could it be a Barrier? What? Just to be safe. That should do it. Let’s go. Right. Now, there’s nowhere left to hide.\NWhat will you do? To think she’d evade all of my attacks. Since it’s come to this, I’ve just got to\Nuse that technique! Wind Style: Sea Dragon! What’s that? Nothing’s happening. How pitiful. It seems the wind\Ndoesn’t like you. I don’t know about that. The wind is my friend. This battle is just starting. Wind Reversal! Die! Darn it! Hey, let go! Done already? I thought\Nwe could play a little more… That’s the spirit! What kind of toy is it this time? That’s funny. You think you can\Ndefeat me with junk like this? The junk is your sword. What?! A three-headed dragon! You’re just quick to escape, eh? Darn it. Sure enough,\NCrow is at a disadvantage unless teamed up with Black Ant. Not bad, Gaara of the desert. How much Chakra is built up\Nin that sand? You want to test that out? However… It’ll be in exchange for your life. Sand Coffin! Impossible. That’s a nice sand bath. You, the sand’s Chakra… Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra. Aw, is this good night? Just sleep as is! For all eternity!! What?! That was a close shave, but Shadow Possession Jutsu\Nwas a success! Die already! Uh, oh! What?

So what do we do? We’ll decide on a password. Password? I’ll only say it once so listen closely. You ask Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.” And the answer is this: “It is a chance to sneak up where a large\N number of enemies are making a scene. “The quiet place has\Nno secret hideout. “It is important for\Na Shinobi to know the right time. “The time when an enemy\Nis tired and drops his guard.” That’s it.

If this creature doesn’t want\Nto spit me out … I’ll make it to do so at any cost! Shadow Clone Jutsu! I can’t move! I wanted you to entertain me more. It’s too bad. Move!

Seems like you brought that\Ngiant snake down brilliantly, Naruto. No matter how you look,\Nshe looks like a snake… I get it, it was the handiwork\Nof this woman. The situation has never gotten any better\Nwith him showing up for the rescue. But what should I do…? Hey hey hey! Evidently you’ve been\Nbullying the weakling! Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here, I’m going to wipe the floor with you! Darn it! If it continues like this,\Nall three of us are done for! What should I do? Sasuke... It’s no good.

Why are you giving\Nour scroll to the enemy? You, shut up! What …?! I see… 					You’re sensible.

That’s correct. The Scroll. I could just kill you\Nand seize it. Don’t mess with me! Run, Naruto! Stop it! Darn it! I’ve lost confidence in you, Sasuke! Summoning Jutsu! Naruto! There are three corpses. This is some kind of Ninja Art,\Nisn’t it… ? This is bad. We have a problem,\Nfrom the get go. I’ll be darned. Inform Anko,\Nthe Proctor of the second test. Yes, sir! If you’re going to have dumplings,\Nyou’ve got to have sweet red bean soup. Okay...\NOnce I’ve eaten this, I should break through and\Ngo wait at the tower for the kids. With this program, the quick kids\Nshould clear it soon. The Leaf Village mark, perfect! We have a problem, Ms. Anko! Huh? What, so suddenly? Corpses! Three of them! Moreover, they’re strange. Anyway, please come! Strange? I checked their possessions\Nand identification, Ninjas from Grass Village\Nregistered in the Chunin Exam, but… As you can see... They have no faces. Yes.

This stupid coward is absolutely\Nnot the Sasuke I know! Huh?! Darn it! 					Let me go! You stupid snake!

Five-Pronged…Sealing! Sasuke! Help Naruto! Twelve years since the seal… Naruto’s Chakras and the nine-tail’s\NChakras are beginning to act in synch… But  now... you’re in the way. He’s gonna fall as it is! Naruto! What happened Sasuke?! Sasuke… Naruto’s certainly different\Nfrom you, Sasuke. He’s a klutz and\Nkind of gets in the way. But he’s not in the least a coward!

194,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Milady, the skies have\Nbegun to look threatening. We should seek lodging for the night\Nbefore we get rained on. I see. Carry on. Yes, Milady. What dense fog?! We cannot see what’s up ahead. What was that? Is something the matter? Lady Kayo! The Mysterious Curse\Nof the Haunted House I hear that it happened while the mistress\Nof the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo, was on her way to visit the household\Nof her parents in Land of Candy. Attendants from Land of Candy\Nwent out to meet them, thinking it odd\Nthat their arrival was delayed, only to find that the palanquin and poles\Nhad been cast away at the mountain pass. I am told that Lady Kayo and\Nall of her attendants have disappeared. Then, our task is to search\Nfor the Lady, right? That is so. Hinata’s Byakugan and Kiba\Nand Akamaru’s keen sense of smell should prove helpful\Nin this search mission, and Naruto is, well, just Naruto. What are you saying, Grandma? That I have nothing in particular\Nto recommend me? But isn’t that the case? I think that you have\Ngood points, too, Naruto… Oh! Leave it to Hinata. Go ahead and list them up\Nfor Grandma Tsunade! Come on,\Nwhat are my good points? Er…umm… 					Let me see… It shouldn’t be that hard! I didn’t mean to make it\Nseem that way… Um…well… Hey there, you two.\NAre you done? Say, Grandma, there wouldn’t be\Nanything odd happening in this mission, would there? Something odd? That is to say…might there perhaps…\Nbe ghosts involved? Ghosts?\NAre you afraid of such things? Well, umm, er…kinda. There are no such things as ghosts. Stop talking such nonsense\Nand get on your way. Which brings us to the question\Nof where to, Fifth Hokage? Kubisaki Pass. K-Kubisaki Pass?\NAs in the Broken Neck Pass? I knew I had a bad premonition. Fool! A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such\Nthings. Get to business! You’re scarier than any ghost! We’re off! Excuse us. It’s always like this with that one… Lady Tsunade,\NKubisaki Pass is where the capital of\Nthe Land of Necks once stood isn't it? The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan, which met its destruction 50 years ago,\Nmust still be there. And what of it? Ruined castles may be found\Njust about anywhere. Have you caught\NNaruto’s cowardice bug, Shizune? N-No, that’s not it. Oh, this is the spot. The Broken Neck Pass. It gives me the creeps\Nsomehow, I tell you. It's started to rain. Let’s hurry. It’s really coming down! A castle. I hadn’t heard anything\Nabout a castle standing here. Somehow,\NI have a bad feeling about this. See, see?! This mission is starting\Nto seem creepier and creepier. But this may be a major clue. Let’s go. Yeah. At this rate,\Nwe’ll get soaking wet. H-Hey, don’t be in such a hurry! What a magnificent castle. Won’t it be sort of rude\Nto suddenly intrude upon them? It’s almost night.\NMaybe we’ll be causing them trouble. Naruto, don’t tell me\Nyou really are scared! N-No way, I tell you! Pull yourself together, Naruto. Let’s go. The door opened by itself! Excuse me, is anybody home? The lights are turned on. Please let us shelter here\Nfrom the rain for a bit! Hey! Wait! Akamaru! Excuse us! Good evening. Something sure smells good. It’s still warm. Was someone here\Nuntil just a little while ago? What’s that? That’s one scary looking guy. I wonder if he’s the master of this castle. If he’s the master of this castle,\Nthan that makes him a feudal lord right? If this is the feudal lord’s castle, then the area around here\Nshould be the capital. But this is right on the country borderline. Hey! Akamaru! What are you doing? You shouldn’t eat that\Nwithout permission. – Naruto? 					– What is it? Don’t startle me like that. Just now, the painting’s eyes moved! You moron. How could a painting move?\NYou’re too much of a scaredy-cat. The table’s set for seven people. So, what of it? The Land of Honey party that\Nwent missing also numbered seven. The Lady and her attendants\Nmay still be in this castle… Let’s split up and search for them. Wha…? 					We gonna split up? Since we’re all here together,\Nwhy don’t we search together? What do you say, Kiba? Hinata? Naruto, stop talking like a kid.\NThis is a mission! You don’t have to scold me so much!\NI know that! Hey! Wait a minute! I’m just not cut out for this kind of stuff. This is scarier than going to the bathroom\Nin the middle of the night! This is creepy! No! Not again! Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru! I’m too scared alone, after all! Do you sense it, too? I’m sure this is\Nthe scent of a human being. It’s here. There’s no one here. I’ll eat you up. Who’s that?\Nls someone there? The ceiling… Take that, you. Look at all these books! The History of Neck Castle… This was written a full fifty years ago! ""The enemy forces\Nhave already surrounded the castle. ""Our people were brutally\Nslaughtered and ""there’re only few of the soldiers\Nleft in castle. ""It seems certain that\NI would not live to see nightfall either. ""But my thirst for vengeance\Nremains in the castle, ""and I vow with this castle\Nto consume every last man, ""every human setting foot\Nwithin these walls… ""Signed, Gosa Kubisaki."" Consume? I’ll eat you… What is this? Gosa Kubisaki! Crap! Hinata! Hey! Hinata! Pull yourself together! Naruto… Naruto, Hinata, are you all right? Kiba, Akamaru! A castle that fell fifty years ago? What nonsense! That is how the scroll is dated. It says that everyone who enters this castle\Nwill be eaten alive. True, we have been swallowed whole! Naruto! Are you okay? Hey! That hurt! There he is! I-I’m sorry! What is this? This isn’t the armor of the Kubisaki Clan. I wonder if this belonged\Nto an enemy soldier… There’s some more over there.\NThey are different armors. Those armors bear\Nthe crest of the Kubisaki Clan. Let’s hurry up and get out of here! That’s the same armor as in the painting! Could it be…\Nthat this is the real Gosa Kubisaki? Gosa Kubisaki? What’s going on? He’s melting! What is this? Something smells really sour. There is something\Nstrange about this castle. Hinata! Yeah. Byakugan! The whole wall is covered\Nwith a flow of Chakra. Why? It’s moving! This wall seems to be alive! What if… Gentle Fist! A-Are you all right, Hinata? Uh-huh. I’ve seen something very similar to this\Nsomewhere before. The giant toad summoned\Nby the Pervy Sage… from inside its stomach! Inside its stomach?! Then, I wonder if, by chance,\Nthis smell could be…gastric juices?! Gosa Kubisaki invoked\Nthe Summoning Jutsu before the fall of the castle. But the thing he summoned… was big enough\Nto swallow the entire castle whole. From the time we entered the castle,\Nwe, too, have been gobbled up! But, why would this thing go to the trouble\Nof transforming to a castle to eat us? I don’t know. What was that? Oh! H-Help! Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey? She’s embedded in the wall. We are from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. We have come to help you. Here, I’ll help you out now. It’s no use. Please hang on! Oh no! This thing is rounding up\Nall the humans inside here and returning to its original form. At this rate, we're in danger too! Naruto, Hinata,\Nwe’ve got to get out of here! Man Beast Clone! Fang over Fang! I am the castle. and by order of my master Gosa,\NI am to eat all who set foot within. Naruto! Ouch… I’ll eat you. How can we get out of its stomach?! I don’t know. If this creature was Summoned, then there should be\Na scroll for the contract. If we tear up the scroll, then this creature\Nshould return to the world it came from. Is that so? – Hinata! 					– Right! Byakugan! Found it. It’s up above.\NProbably in the castle tower. How are we supposed to\Nget up there in this situation?! The wall’s Chakra have\Nbegun to stabilize again. Who's that? Gosa Kubisaki! I won’t be fooled again. That, too, is just a phantom\Ncreated by the Summoning. Wait! He looks different from the one before. Wh-What’s he doing? He seems to want us to follow him. Huh? He disappeared! Naruto, over there. Oh, it’s the scroll! It's starting to act up again.\NHurry, Naruto! Right! This is… It’s the true form\Nof the Summoned animal. The concentration of acid is increasing. Hey, let’s hurry and wind things up! Wait a minute. What if, when this summoned animal\Ngoes back to where it came from, it takes us with it, too? We’ll just have to take our chances.\NWe gotta do this! Right. Did that do it? What the--?! Naruto! Naruto! Over there, Naruto. It should be possible\Nto tear the wall at that spot. Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan! Naruto! The lord of this castle must have died resenting the people\Nwho seized the castle from him. But, he also led us\Nto where the scroll was hidden… Then, does that mean that\Nhe decided to let go of his grudge? Surely that must be the case. What’s more, he must have felt sorry for the Summoned animal that\Nnobly served him for fifty years, and wanted to release it. I see. Then maybe he was waiting\Nfor someone to release the Summoned animal\Nfrom its spell. And now, it has finally been able to\Nreturn to its own world.

Yeah! Awesome Chakra started bursting\Nthroughout my body. My power goes up like crazy! That’s a rare Jutsu, isn’t it? Shizune, have we identified the one\Nwho attacked the villagers? No, not yet… Menma. I’ve once heard of\Na Jutsu similar to yours. – What?!\N– Is that true, Grandma?! I seem to recall that\Nthe Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu that use musical instruments as\Nthe catalysts. Land of Rice Paddies?\NYou mean that Land of Rice Paddies? Come to think of it, the upper part of the mountain stream\Nwhere Naruto found Menma was… Land of Rice Paddies? Please allow me to go there! But infiltrating another land\Nwithout cause is… No, we do have cause! There might be hints there\Nabout Menma’s lost memory. I’d also like to make that request. Very well. Excellent, Grandma!\NNow you’re talking! Thank you. Bringing Back Reality And so we’ll be heading out for a bit. Right, got it. The special pickled bamboo shoots\Nshould be ready by the time you guys get back. I can’t wait. Bye! Really, there’s no real need\Nfor you guys to come. We have no choice. It’s a mission. Our mission is to accompany you guys! Now that it’s settled… Let’s get to the Land of Rice Paddies! Right. – Naruto. 					– Huh? You stay here. Huh? What do you want, Grandma? If you’re any kind of sorry excuse\Nfor a Shinobi, you should know. What? I’m talking about Menma.\Nlf that kid is a… No way is he a bad guy. I know he’s not a bad person. But can you state flatly that\Nhe’s not an enemy spy? What’re you driving at, Grandma?! You couldn’t have forgotten. The Village Hidden in Sound\Nin the Land of Rice Paddies is the place where Orochimaru\Nonce hid himself. Well, I… I…remember that, but… Menma’s Jutsu is strikingly similar to that\Nof the opponent Shikamaru fought when Sasuke was taken away. There’s no denying there’s a chance he’s affiliated with\Nthe Hidden Sound Village. And if he remembers something and\Nthat was to become a threat to this land… No way could Menma be an enemy…\NThat just can’t be! We’ll leave you behind if you dawdle! Naruto, I’m going on ahead! Are you hurt? No… Thanks for the help. You were going a bit too fast. Let’s take a break. What the heck’s wrong?! Who in the world is he? We’re going to investigate\Nbecause we don’t know that. I was running at full speed earlier. Losing my footing on the branch\Nafter that was on purpose, though… What? Not only did he keep up with my speed, but he even showed\Nthe composure to save me. He is better than us in terms of speed. He’d be a troublesome opponent\Nif we end up fighting. Wha--?\NHey, hey, wait a minute. He’s not an enemy! He risks his life to rescue babies. And he’s the kind of guy who,\Nif left on his own, would help those in trouble all day! That’s a nice sound. I still hadn’t thanked you\Nfor fixing this for me. Don’t worry about it. Hey! Stop playing that right now! If you don’t… Neji. What’s the big idea?! You keep quiet! What?! It’s as Neji says. That might’ve been\Na signal to an enemy! A signal? Lady Tsunade approved this mission\Nbecause the suspicious person who entered the village the other day\Nstill hasn’t been caught! If that intruder has followed Menma… he should be close to us now. No way… As of this point, he hasn’t shown\Nhis presence, though. Our mission is to accompany Naruto, verify his identity and\Nto capture the intruder! Sorry, but I don’t trust you! That’s right…\Nlt’s natural I’d be thought of like that… I think about this\Nfrom time to time… What kind of a person was I? What would I do if I were\Na bad person…? Naruto, what kind of person would\Nyou want to be if you were reborn? Wh-What’s this all of a sudden? I’m speaking figuratively… I’ve never thought about it. I see… But why do you ask\Nsomething like that? Oh, no special reason… What is it? What’s this smell? Now that you mention it,\Nit smells like something’s burning. Over there. Let’s go. The smell came from here… Was there a fire or something…? Is something wrong? No… It’s nothing. Don’t move. I’ll fire if you move. What’s the deal all of a sudden? Are you their minions? “Their”? You’ll die here if\Nyou’re comrades of theirs. For crying out loud, who are they?! If you say you’re not,\Nthen show me some proof! Proof, why? We’re Leaf Shinobi. Hidden Leaf Village? See? Look at this. Indeed that is… What do Leaf Shinobi want\Nin a place like this? Well, we just happened\Nto be passing through and… As you can see, there’s nothing here. If you don’t have business here,\Njust beat it. If you don’t,\Nwe can’t guarantee your life. What’s with him talking all big?! Here, he was the one\Nwho picked the fight. Once we’ve had our breather, let’s blow this joint and go look\Nfor Menma’s memory. R-Right… What? Did you remember something? No… Who’s there? Come on out. Hello. Y-You guys are Ninja, right? I heard what you were talking\Nabout earlier… Oh, well, I don’t want to brag, but… If you’re talking about Naruto Uzumaki\Nfrom Hidden Leaf Village, I’m pretty well known. Really? I’m sorry, I didn’t know. Why did you go to the trouble\Nof following us? Umm… I had a favor to ask… My older brother said\Nwhat he did earlier, but… Older brother?! That jerk from earlier? We need someone to save our village! A person to save your village…? What do you mean? This was the border of\Nthe Land of Rice Paddies. But… as our land had caused trouble\Nfor other lands, this area was turned into\Na demilitarized zone. Are you talking about\Nthat thing in question…? It must be the incident\Ninvolving Orochimaru. That’s how things were settled\Nwith all the neighboring lands, huh? But if it’s a demilitarized zone,\Nthere won’t be any territorial dispute, right? That’s right. It’s not like that. There’s a small mine\Nin the hills behind the village and a little bit of gold can be dug up. Once it was discovered that mine is not\Nbeing supervised by a proprietary land, bandits started coming with\Ntheir eyes on the gold… No matter how often we asked\Nthe feudal lord, he would insist that, “Agreements between\Nfellow lands must not be broken.” And the village… It was attacked by bandits, right? They withdrew in the middle of it\Ndue to a terrible storm before. But they’ll definitely be back. I beg you. Please save our village. You guys could fight them! All right! Got it… I’m sorry. We can understand the situation,\Nbut we can’t cooperate. Huh? What’re you saying, Neji?! We’re in the middle of a mission! We can’t act unless\Nwe have an official order from the village! But… Besides, we don’t know\Nwhen the bandits will be back. We can’t just strand\Nourselves here forever! Damn it… I see… What’re you doing Ran,\Neven bringing Fuki here? Big Brother… Don’t get involved with them.\NThere’s no such thing as a good Ninja. Say what?! I just stated the truth. The rumor has it that the guys who\Nattacked the village were Rogue Shinobi from the Hidden Sound Village. Huh? The bandits are Ninja? Come this way. Look at that. Wh-What’s this?! One-third of the villagers were killed\Nin the attack the other day. Half of the rest abandoned\Nthe village and fled. Then you guys should also evacuate… Where are we supposed to flee?! This is ancestral land\Nthat’s been handed down to us and that we’ve cultivated. Why should we have to flee from that?! Each time the hooligans\Nbrandish their power, we have to accept it like\Na natural disaster and do nothing?! Are we to just flee from place to place?! Don’t shout, Big Brother. Fuki will get scared. I’m sorry I shouted… Her parents were killed by bandits\Nand she lost her ability to speak. There’s no place for us to escape. If that’s clear, then beat it already. We have no choice.\NLet’s hurry on ahead. I’m staying here. Huh? I want to be of use if\Nthose people are in trouble. Menma! Hey, you don’t even know\Nthe scale of the bandits. If you want to help them,\Nno matter what, then we should go back\Nto the village and… We don’t know when they might attack. We don’t have the time\Nto return to the village! Then, I’m staying, too! Naruto! Anything further than this\Nis beyond the scope of the mission! This isn’t beyond the scope\Nof the mission! I get the feeling I’ll be able to\Nremember something if I stay here. Don’t say irresponsible things! You couldn’t remember anything\Njust a moment ago… That’s too convenient! It can’t be helped, right?\NMenma himself is saying so. He’s good-natured to a fault! Naruto… Let’s go, Menma. Right. Hey, Naruto! We’ll deal with the bandits. You guys go on back\Nto the village ahead. What do we do, Neji?! Leave them be. It’s unlikely the villagers will\Naccept Naruto and Menma. You’ve got a point… It seems the settlement on the other side\Nhas escaped damage, huh? But how’re we supposed to protect\Nthe village just the two of us…? Let’s build a wall along this creek.\NThis river will play the role of a moat. Ultimately we’ll make a temporary bridge and have the entrance to the village\Nin just one location. I get it… I don’t know how effective it’ll be, but let’s just do the best\Nwe can now. Right. What’re you doing? I told you to get out. We won’t get out! What did you say?! We decided to protect\Nthe village on our own. Nobody asked you to do that.\Nlt’s none of your business! You may say that, but you can’t beat them off\Nby just hiding in your houses! All right, let’s stabilize it with a stake. Got it… Jeez, what can they do\Njust the two of them?! I’m ready… Okay. Tenten! You’re still here?! Can’t you at least say thanks first? Thanks, Tenten. Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right. R-Right… You are… For me? Then I’ll help myself. Have this, too.

No worries. Sasuke is now recuperating at home. Thanks to Lady Tsunade. At this rate, seems like he’ll be able\Nto get back to his duties very soon. I see. That’s very good. Lady Tsunade is great, after all. I think if you had her take a look,\Nyou’d get better very quickly. Yes… But if there is something\Nthat I can do, please feel free to tell me. Thank you very much, Sakura. Then I’ll see you soon. I would think that at least\None bar would be open. There’s no way.\NWhat time do you think it is right now? I can’t drink sake, and I can’t gamble. This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,\Nis no fun at all. Just like the Third Hokage. Lady Tsunade! Oh, I’m tired. I just want to sit down and\Nhave a drink somewhere. I understand. I will take you to a place where\Nyou can sit and have a drink. What? But I will have you do your work! Here now, go ahead. It’s hot. Shizune…you’ve suddenly\Nbecome very strict! I haven’t gotten strict.\Nlt’s probably that you were not aware. Not aware?! “If I can’t get in the room,\Nthen I don’t have to work.” Isn’t that what you were thinking? And that’s why\Nyou left it up to Naruto. Humph!

Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty\Nand is well-balanced. My shoulders are stiff. I’m going to go get\Nsome fresh air outside. Success… Success… Naruto… Uh… Darn! If that’s how you’re going to be,\Nthen I’m not going to go easy on you. This is the Old Man’s room! I won’t let anybody\Nuse this room besides him! The Old Man’s…?

The Hidden Leaf Village is\Nin great trouble right now! Our forces have dropped to almost half,\Nand we have to finish our missions! That’s what I taught you! Yeah… um… well… But if we don’t accomplish\Nour missions, that’s letting other countries know\Nthat the village has been weakened. That’s what Iruka Sensei taught you! Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade? It’s not that!\Nlt’s not that at all. Then what is it? Soon, nobody will call me\Nhonorable grandson. Then I’ll just become\Nplain old Konohamaru. So what’s wrong with\Nplain old Konohamaru? No… Why, why?! You hated\Nbeing called honorable grandson! Everybody’s going to forget\Nabout the Old Man. The Old Man. They’re going to forget what\Na great Ninja he was, they’re just going to put him away\Nlike an old ashtray. The new Hokage will make all kinds\Nof changes in the Leaf Village. That’s not true! The Hidden Leaf Village is\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village. And besides,\Nnobody will forget about the Old Man! No! They will never forget about him! They will forget, I guarantee it. They won’t forget! That’s a lie! It’s not a lie!\NYou can’t believe what I am saying?! That’s right, I can't! Oh boy! Come with me, Konohamaru! We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade\Nto promise that she won’t change\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. And then on top of that, we can get everybody to promise us\Nthat they won’t forget about the Old Man! What? Isn’t that what you want? I can’t believe that I let\NLady Tsunade out of my sight! Did you find her, Tonton? Revitalizing the cells, I see. I’ve found you Lady Tsunade. What? Lady Tsunade is studying?! Be quiet! I can’t concentrate. Concentrate?! I’ve never heard you use that word\Nexcept when you're gambling. Is that Shizune’s voice? Shizune… Do you remember that Medical Ninja\Nby the name of Kabuto? What about him? His ability to create new cells. I was researching ways to use\Nthat power on the patients. For Lee? If the 50% chance becomes 51%,\Nit’s worth a try. It really depends on the individual’s traits. Even for you,\Nit might be hard to acquire those powers. I’ll just have to try. I am the Fifth Hokage, after all. It can’t be helped, Konohamaru. I am the Third Hokage, after all. If you don’t like it,\Nyou should just quit! Everybody from the village\Nis my family. To protect the family,\Nthat is the duty of a Hokage. Oh! Old Man! Just for today,\NI’m making a special exception. What’s the matter Konohamaru? Don’t you want to see\NOld Lady Tsunade? No. I’ll just have to do it.\NI am the Fifth Hokage, after all. It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.\NI am the Third Hokage, after all. It can’t be helped.\NI am the honorable grandson, after all. Huh? I am Konohamaru of\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village, after all!

If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying Then I want to deliver you a smile,\Neven if I’m not by your side Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands I can feel it so close, Our two hearts Please, Sensei! – What?! 					– What?! Whoa, my heart, my heart! Huh? There's nothing wrong. Hey, it's you again. To think you'd transform into Kurenai\Nwith a Transformation Jutsu. Hey, what the heck was that earlier? Shut up! For your sake,\Ndon't be nosing around needlessly. Hey! You're Yakumo. Right? I want to ask you something\Nabout Kurenai Sensei! D-Damn it! This is…the Academy's hallway. Sensei, please! Yakumo's Sealed Power Why am I no good?! Kurenai Sensei? I want to become a Ninja,\Nno matter what! I must become one! I told you to give up. No! Then I’ll just have to perform\Na Sealing Jutsu and seal your power. Huh? Huh?! Kurenai Sensei! Why?! S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?! As for me,\Nwhat am I doing lying here?! Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei\Ngot stabbed and my heart leapt out\Nof my chest and… No, that’s not it.\NWhere’s that girl? Where’s Yakumo? It seems you don’t remember at all. You got caught breaking\Ninto a mountain cottage under special security! Huh…?! The Anbu Black Ops are in action, so you should be thankful\Nyou’re alive! Oh yeah! The dream I just had…\Nlt was strangely real. No doubt it was the girl\Nin the mountain cottage! What’re you blabbing about?! I’ll inject you with a stimulant\Nif you don’t knock it off. I can’t be doing stuff like this! Hold it! The medicine hasn’t worn off, yet! Sensei! Kurenai Sensei! Kurenai’s already gone out. What?! You’ve gone to the trouble\Nof getting up early. So how about joining me for\Nan early-morning marathon? This isn’t the time for that! Morning marathons are great! Marathons purge the sweat\Nand impurities built up in your body from a night of sleep. More importantly,\Nwhere did Kurenai Sensei go?! Come to think of it, she said something about going\Nto visit someone… Something about a student she took care of in the past\Nbeing in poor health… Huh? She went to see Yakumo! Then at least join me for\Nsome morning exercise! Morning exercise purges the sweat\Nand impurities built up in your body from a night of sleep… Kurenai Sensei! Whoa?! I have something I want to ask you,\NKurenai Sensei. Naruto, don’t stick your nose\Ninto my business any further. Yesterday I went to see Yakumo! I don’t know if it was\Non account of that, but I just had a strangely real dream! A dream…? Yeah. You said to Yakumo that you were\Ngoing to use a Sealing Jutsu if she wouldn’t give up\Nbecoming a Ninja… Sorry, but I’m in a hurry… H-Hey. Wait! It doesn’t concern you… Yes, it does! Hinata, Kiba and Shino are\Nall troubled because you said you were\Ngoing to quit! Doesn’t the fact that\Nyou’re quitting Squad Eight have something to do with\Nthat girl Yakumo?! What you saw wasn’t just a dream… What…?! I used a Sealing Jutsu and\Ntook away a student’s power! No way. That couldn’t be! It happened over a year ago… By my own hand,\NI crushed the dream of a girl… I tutored individually named Yakumo… who was trying to become\Na practitioner of Genjutsu. No way! I don’t deserve to have\Nthe lives of the Genin in Squad Eight entrusted to me. But why…? Now, get out of my way! That’s the end of this conversation. No way…\NBut I still have stuff I want to ask you…! I have no choice. What's happening?! They won’t come off! Kurenai Sensei, that’s just cruel! We’re already surrounded… Make emergency contact\Nwith the village… Yes, sir. There! What?! We’re counting on you! What?! Hurry…to the Hokage! Yakumo… Come with us. Geez, that Naruto. The least he could do is thank me\Nfor attending to him all night. What?! Isn’t it about tea time? After you’ve taken care of\Nthese documents! Why’s there so much work? It’s because you didn’t take care\Nof it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade. It’s a carrier pigeon for\Nemergency contacts! What?! It’s from the mountain cottage\Nin Satomi Hill… Something’s happened to Yakumo! There’s a possibility that\Na person being protected by the Village Hidden in Leaves,\NYakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped. Head for the mountain cottage in\NSatomi Hill and secure Yakumo. Yakumo Kurama… As I recall, that’s the girl Kurenai\Ntook custody of, right? Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo\Nof the Kurama Clan head family. Umm, what’s the Kurama Clan? It’s natural that you guys wouldn’t know. They were a distinguished family that wielded considerable power\Nin the village, but they’re just a shadow\Nof what they used to be. The death of Murakumo\Nand his wife about a year ago became the catalyst for that. I hear that the clan fell apart\Nafter that. Does the kidnapping of the only\Ndaughter of the head family mean that the Kurama Clan’s\NSecret Jutsu is being targeted? Well… According to the documents handed down from\Nthe Third Hokage, it seems her latent powers as\Na Genjutsu Ninja are extremely dangerous… In other words, she would make\Nfor a powerful asset if those powers can be awakened. That means it wouldn’t\Nbe surprising if there were guys seeking\Nthat power, huh? After her parents died, she was kept under\Nprotective custody in the village. All right. Leave it to me! I won’t allow a girl to cry! Might Guy,\Nthe Leaf Village's Handsome Devil will rescue her,\Nno matter what! Sakura, you go with them as well. – What?! 					– Huh? Once we have her in custody, we’ll need someone to look\Nafter her condition. Only one with experience as\Na Medical Ninja can do this. Y-Yes ma’am! This mission is a chance\Nto show my master the fruits of my training! Ouch! Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root\Nor something? What’s this?! N-Naruto…! He fell asleep in a place like this?! Nice, Akamaru! Naruto… He’s…caught in a Genjutsu! – Huh? 					– Huh? Release! What…? Sakura… Salty! What the hell is this?!\NI mean, was I asleep again? What’re you babbling about?! You were caught in a Genjutsu. Genjutsu… I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei who was heading for\Nthe Satomi mountain cottage and I tried to get her to listen to me. Satomi mountain cottage,\Nyou say? Then Kurenai went alone? Yeah, probably. Kurenai’s in danger if she went without being aware\Nwhat’s happening! Huh? Something’s strange… Someone’s here! Damn it. Was it a mistake\Nto come alone…? But I don’t have the time\Nto return to the village… They’re most likely after…Yakumo. What?! Oh no! Sorry, but I mustn’t allow you\Nto interfere with our work. Wha--?! You think you caught me with that? What?! You’re the one who’s caught! The enemies are also practitioners\Nof Genjutsu. I must not lose… What’s this presence?! They’re both caught in a Genjutsu. Yakumo… Is that you, Yakumo? So you were safe! Help me! It’s okay now, Yakumo. I’ll protect you, no matter what. Kurenai Sensei! Release! You were hit with\Na reverse Genjutsu, eh? I-I’m sorry. Just what I’d expect from\Na Jonin… No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi… Stay alert! We should consider ourselves as being under suspicion\Nby the Leaf Village. – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir! The two who took Yakumo\Nhaven’t returned… I guess somewhat violent action\Ncan’t be avoided. Although we come from\Nthe same village… we will get Yakumo,\Nno matter what the cost. Understood? – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir! Oh! What is it, Hinata?! Did you see something? The mountain cottage is\Nbeing attacked by someone. There are four out front and four inside\Nthe mountain cottage. Are two of the people inside\Nthe mountain cottage Kurenai and Yakumo? I bet that’s it! Kurenai Sensei,\Nwhat the hell happened?! Tell us!

35,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. Special technique! Shadow  Clone Jutsu, fishing version! Thrash about more! I want to catch some for curing! Three isn't enough! Three more, you loser! This is very taxing, you know?! I mean, let's switch! Sasuke! The fire's ready to light!\NFireballs please. I guess three is okay for the time being… Wha--? Hey, wait a minute! The Scroll's Secret:\NNo Peeking Allowed It's already been four days\Nsince the second exam started. Yeah. That's right. The start of the second exam\Nwas around three in the afternoon. We only have twenty-five or\Ntwenty-six hours left. There may already be\Nsome teams that have passed. That means… I wonder if it'll be broiled soon. We're soon going to be in a hot spot… That's the biggest one. Believe it! Okay… Even if we were to try pursuit, there's probably hardly anybody left\Nto become targets. What do we do? Almost everyone's surely already passed. Yeah.  It's already been\Nfour days, after all. Anyway… It's early afternoon now… Let's have a meal. You two rest a bit and\NI'll go find us something to eat. Say… Hmm? As I recall, on the other one… ""Heaven"" was written here… and unlike this,\Nboth edges of the scroll were whitish, right? Umm, when I was shown\Nthe scroll before the exam, I wasn't really looking. So, what of it all of a sudden? Y-You've got to be kidding…? For all we know… there may not be any Heaven scrolls. What do you mean, Sakura? Well, in this second exam… four of the five-day\Ntime limit have passed already. So that means we've already\Nused eighty percent of the total exam time. Seventy-eight participants\Nand twenty-six teams. There are only thirteen each\Nof the Heaven and Earth scrolls. At most there are only\Nthirteen passing teams. Moreover, you remember,\Ndon’t you, Sasuke? That the Orochimaru guy burned\N the “Heaven scroll” that we had. Which means… The teams that will pass had already,\Nat that point, decreased by one. Hmm? Also, all of the other scrolls are\Nnot necessarily safe, so… After parting ways with\Nthe Leaf Village bunch, we allotted two days for healing… So from here on, we have to increase\Nthe distance of our actions. At any rate,\Nthe next enemy is our last chance. I'm going to get some drinking water. Say! Say! I have a good way for us not to fight\Nwith an enemy. Believe it! What?! Get serious! I am serious. I have lots of scrolls stocked, so. Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,\Nfor notes…. If we tweak this a little and change it\Ninto exactly like the Heaven scroll… H-Hold it! Huh? Even if you did such a thing,\Nyou don't know what's written on the inside! If the Proctor looked inside\Nyou will be discovered right away! Idiot! Generally with things like this, there's a password or\Nsomething written and you can’t get it\Nunless you have both scrolls. In other words… to pass at the tower goal,\Nwe'll surely need a password. Or something like that.\NBelieve it! What difference does it make? If you don't know the content,\Nthere's no use making a fake! Man, here I was wondering what\Nyou were going to say, looking all big… You're an idiot who just can't\Nthink through things. B-But… What if we could predict the content…? This Earth scroll… You wouldn't… I'm going to…open this scroll! No! You! Have you forgotten\Neven the rules, you idiot? We were told not to look inside the scrolls\Nuntil arriving at the tower, right? But, at this rate,\Nwe’ll be in a hot spot, right? There might be a trap or something. Carefully… Be careful. Yeah. I know… Hey, what's wrong? Hey! What's wrong? What happened?! Hey! Hey! 					Answer me! You'd best not do it. An enemy? Man, you're beyond saving… That was close. W-We're sorry. Those who ignored the rules are forced\Ninto the situation of having to retire. In the previous exam, hypnotism\NJutsu Formula was set up to get into the eyes of those who looked\Nat the scroll along the way. A measure to get them to lie\Nin the forest until the end of the exam. By the way… If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right? What're you doing hanging\Naround here alone? It's not that I'm after your scroll. I didn't think so. If that was your intention…\Nyou could've taken it from Naruto just now. So you're also after the Heaven scroll? No. I already have them both. See? What? Things led to things… I was hurrying over to\Nthe vicinity of the tower to wait for my estranged companions. Now, if you'll excuse me… Wait! Fight me. Lucky! Fight you, you say? S-Sasuke. This idiot-suke. What are you saying suddenly? Are you serious? Sorry, but we don't have anymore time. Hey, Sasuke!\NKabuto saved us! Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself. Shut up! Sasu…ke. It can't be helped.\NI said it before, too. This is all that can be done\Nto survive through this forest now. Hmm…That's a lie. A lie? Your heart isn't totally in this\Nas much as you're saying. If you could really become\Nserious about this exam… Why is it necessary to fight me? You should jump on me\Nat my unguarded moment, without going to\Nthe trouble of announcing it. That's…a Ninja. Hmm, that's profound. I don't dislike that side of you. So I shall tell you the way you should go. However…let's talk as we move. The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke\Nhad reached a great distance. At this rate, we'll be marked\Nby fierce animals…and enemies. Humph! Are there really still enemies around? Yes, no mistake. If you think about it a little,\Nyou'll understand. Do you know the cleverest way\Nof fighting in battles in jungles and\Nexpansive forests such as this? No. The tower located in the center\Nof this forest, the common goal for us test-takers. That means when the last day\Nof the test is here… the area near that tower is\Nthe easiest place to gather scrolls. Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right? In other words, we go after the scrolls\Nof the teams that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls\Nand are setting out for the tower. That's one-third of the answer. What? I mean that you guys are\Nnot the only ones thinking that! Near the tower, the same badgers\Nhave probably already set traps, so… I see! That means there are lots of enemies\Nlying in wait to engage us. Heh, having a handicap\Ngets me pumped, I say! I'm looking forward to it! If we just beat them all and\Nget the Heaven scroll, we'll all survive the second exam! No! This is still two-thirds of the answer! What's the remaining\None-third of the answer? The collectors who are certain\Nto appear during an exam of this nature. Collectors? In this exam, with the tower\Njust a stone's throw away, you definitely can't rest easy… Those particular conditions\Nare what create them. In other words,\Nthose who gather extra scrolls… as compensation for sparing them\Nwhen coming across an unexpected enemy. Also, those who get information to\Nproceed favorably through later exams by providing the lacking scrolls to\Ncomrades sharing the same village.

It goes without saying,\Nbut these guys are quite the big guns and the worst enemies who\Nare definitely not conceited. I see. I understand the reason\Nwhy you appeared before us. You're scared, too, right? That's right. Now then, the tower has finally\Ncome into view. From here on is the hard part. All right, let's go! An enemy already? There! Oh, it's just a centipede. Yikes! It's huge. All those legs are gross. Naruto. Huh? I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and\Ncareless actions from here on. Huh? Rushing ahead through a dense forest\Nmaking noise like an elephant is the same as serving notice\Nin a loud voice that we're coming. We'd definitely receive\Nan enthusiastic welcome. O-Oh, I see. As long as time allows, we should\Ngo slowly while remaining hidden. – Yeah. 					– Okay. Sure. Heh, not bad, everyone. Oh? Okay, it's this way. Is it a trap? Yeah.

For crying out loud,\Nhow far have we walked? The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer. Here we can see it right\Nin front of our eyes. Strange… No mistake about it. It seems that we're already\Nwithin the enthusiastic welcome. Take a look at that. Oh, that can't be! What on earth is going on? No way! Is it Genjutsu…? So it seems. We were lured in perfectly. It appears we were\Nmeticulously careful, and were made to walk around\Nthe same place in a circle. We're being watched… Probably. They intend to wear down\Nour physical strength and catch us unprepared\Nwhen we're bone-tired. If so, then this follows the enemy strategy. Then... they'll be coming soon. They’ve appeared. Hah! This is the perfect handicap. Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

He's still trembling. Poor thing. I'm trembling with…excitement. Do it, Sasuke. I can see him! Well, well. So you discerned\Nthe Water Doppelganger Jutsu. That brat's grown quite a bit. This means a rival has emerged, Haku. So it seems. Damn it! I'm totally late! Well, well… It seems my prediction\Nwas right on the money. Prediction? That little mask... Oh! I knew it… Heh! So the Elite Shinobi of\Nthe Hidden Mist thing was a bald-faced lie! No matter how you look at him,\Nhe's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.

No, we do. You didn’t pick up on it? Akahoshi the village leader\Nknows something! What do you mean by\Nknowing something? Come to think of it, when Sumaru was talking about\Nthe Kujaku something or other, his expression changed. Then that means the culprit is\Nsomeone associated with this village? So, like I said, what does this mean?! I’ll make a go around the village and look for something that\Ncould make for a lead. Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over\Nthat village leader called Akahoshi.

Thanks for saving my butt back there! Is there something wrong with you? No…nothing at all… After Mizura began the star training,\Nhe started to feel poorly… Hokuto! Don’t be talking about the star to someone from another village! Are you okay, Mizura…?! I’m sorry. I got carried away… Other village…\NYou guys are kind of cold-hearted.

It happened ten years ago… Sumaru’s parents who\Nwere protecting the star were killed by Ninja from\Nsome other village… who came to steal the star. So probably, he’s… So that’s what it was about…\NThat’s why he got like that. So where is Sumaru…?\NAnd where the other guys? It seems everyone went\Nto take back the star. Huh?! Oh! Naru…to? They’ve come out. Right… We should take them on\Nfair and square here… Idiot! There’d be no point\Nto surveillance! I’m not much one for\Nsniffing around secretly. Be quiet. They’ll notice us!

Uh-oh… Have we been noticed? Wait… It appears we weren’t noticed… Let’s continue trailing them! Right! They turned right! R-Roger! They vanished… Did they give us the slip? Could it be, they noticed us? Wait…! We’re not enemies! That’s right! We came here on a mission from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves! Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say? Then aren’t you guys trailing\Nthe wrong people? That might be so. But there’s the possibility that\Nyou guys have transformed into people from this village, so… Brave words. I apologize for the rudeness… But now the star has been stolen. And we don’t have any leads… So that’s why\Nyou were investigating us, huh…? That was unnecessary… Oh well… We will take back\Nthe star with our own hands. You guys just make sure\Nyou don’t get in our way! They kind of tick me off… But it’s as Neji said… It seems there’s some kind\Nof secret in this village, eh? Seems so… Everyone…join hands! Listen up! Pick up the same\Nstar Chakra as us! There he is! You can’t cut a rope woven\Nwith Chakra! Give back the star!\NThat’s our life! Neji, have you seen Sumaru\Nand the others? You weren’t keeping watch of him? Actually, it seems most of the guys\Nwent out to look for the star. I see… Hey… is it okay to be all relaxed? Hey, is something wrong? There’s massive Chakra\Nat the Valley of Death. Did he appear again?! Let’s go! All right! G-Give back our…star… Give it back… Hold it! Eat this! Ninja Art: Kujaku! I won’t let you get away! Hold it! Farewell! Wh-What?! Damn you! Wait! Let me go! Let me go, I say! Calm down! Up ahead is the valley filled\Nwith poison gas… O-Okay… You would’ve been dead meat in\Na few seconds without that mask on… Damn it. We almost had him. So that was the Shinobi\Nwho stole the star? Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it! Why? Why is it necessary\Nto go out of his way to take Sumaru away although\Nhe carried out his goal already? Does that have something to do with the star being targeted\Nten years ago? At that time, it seems Sumaru’s parents\Ngot killed protecting the star. What?!

Rockin' my heart He's late. Naruto! Stay still. Why's it that only\Nour squad's teacher is late? The other squads have gone off\Nsomewhere with their new teachers, and Iruka Sensei's also left. Don't look at me. Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?! Hey! It'll be his fault because he's late. Man! You're asking for it! I like stuff like this! A Jonin wouldn't get caught\Nin such a weak booby trap. That's right. You're such an idiot...! I got him, I got him... I-I'm sorry, sir. I tried to stop him,\Nbut Naruto did it on his own... It's all good. Get real.\Nls he really a Jonin? How can I put this? As for my first impression\Nof you guys...? Well, I hate you. Pass or Fail: Survival Test Let's see. First off, let me have\Nyou guys introduce yourselves. Introduce ourselves... What should we say? Your likes, dislikes, your future dream,\Nhobbies, things like that! Hey!  Before that, please tell us\Nabout yourself. Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake. I don't feel like telling you\Nguys about my likes and dislikes. I've never really thought\Nabout my future dream... As for my hobbies, I have many. In the end,\Nisn't all we know his name? Yeah. Next is you guys. Let's start with you. My name's Naruto Uzumaki! I like instant ramen, but what I like even more\Nis the ramen from Ichiraku that Iruka Sensei treats me to. What I dislike is the three minutes after pouring hot water\Nin the instant ramen. My hobby is eating and\Ncomparing ramen! And my future dream... is to surpass the Hokage! And so I'm going to get\Nthe entire village to acknowledge my existence! I see... this kid's grown up in\Nan interesting way. Okay, next. I'm Sakura Haruno. What I like... I mean, who I like is... And, my hobby is, 					I mean... My future dream is... And?\NWhat about your dislikes? Naruto! Girls at her age are probably\Nmore interested in love than the Ninja Arts. And lastly. My name's... Sasuke Uchiha. I have lots of dislikes,\Nbut no likes in particular. Oh... And... I don't feel like summing up\Nmy ambition as just a dream but I do have an ambition! The ambition to restore my clan\Nand without fail... to kill a certain man! He doesn't... mean me, does he? Sure enough, Sasuke's cool. I knew it... Good! The three of you are very distinctive\Nand interesting! We'll have a mission tomorrow! Yes, sir! What kind of mission? First, we'll do what we can do\Nwith just four people. What-what-what?! A survival exercise. Survival exercise? Why are we doing an exercise even though this is supposed\Nto be a mission? We've had more than our share\Nof exercises in the Academy! This is no simple exercise. Then... then what kind of exercise is it? Hey! What's so funny, Sensei? Uh, well, if I tell you,\NI know you'll grow disenchanted. What? Of the twenty-seven graduates, only nine will be recognized\Nas junior ninjas. The remaining eighteen will\Nbe sent back to the Academy. In other words, this exercise\Nis an extremely difficult test with a failure rate of 66% or higher! See, see? You got disenchanted! That's crazy! To have suffered that much! T-Then, what was\Nthe graduation test for? Oh, that. It was just to select those who have\Nthe potential of becoming Genin. Whaaaat?! Well, that's the way it is. I'll be determining whether\Nyou pass or fail. Bring your complete set\Nof Ninja tools! We meet at five in the morning. N-No way am I going to be\Ndropped now! I've got to have my strength\Nrecognized for real. I'll be separated from Sasuke\Nif I fail this test. This is an exercise of love! Okay! You're dismissed. Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast. You'll throw up. Morning. Hi, folks. Good morning! You're late! Well, a black cat crossed\Nmy path, you see. Ahem! Oh well... Okay, it's set for 12:00! Today's assignment is to take\Nthese bells away from me by noon. Those who can't do it won't get lunch. They'll be tied to that... and I'll eat my lunch\Nbefore your very eyes. So that was the point... for us not to eat breakfast... But, hold on. Why are there only two bells? There are only two,\Nso at the very least, one will have to\Ngo to the logs. That person will be disqualified\Nfor failing the mission... and will return to the Academy. It might be one person\Nat the very least, or it could be all three of you. You can use your Shuriken. You won't be able to take the bells\Nunless you come with the intent to kill me. But, that's dangerous, sir! Y-Yeah, that's right! You couldn't even evade\Na chalkboard eraser! In this world, those who aren't skilled enough\Ntend to complain more. Well, just ignore the loser... Begin when I give\Nthe ""ready-go"" signal. Loser, loser, loser. Don't be so hasty.\NI didn't say start, yet. No way...! I didn't see him at all. So this is a Jonin. But, that's fine. At least you came with\N the intent to kill me. How can I put this...? I feel like I'm finally starting... to like you guys. We're going to start. Ready... start! What do you want to know? I didn't think you just\Ncame here to drink tea. The Jonin in Naruto and company's\NGroup Seven... What kind of teacher is he?\Nls he strict? You mean Kakashi?\NDoes he concern you? I heard a rumor that concerns me. What's this? It's a pass-fail list of\Nthe junior ninjas Kakashi has been\Nin charge of up until now. Let me have a look. T-This is...! Fundamentally, ninja must mask\Ntheir presence and hide. Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well... Alright! Let's face off\Nfair and square! Oh? That goof. Say, aren't you a bit\Noff kilter? What's off kilter\Nis your hairstyle! I'll teach you the first\NShinobi Battle Jutsu... Taijutsu. Taijutsu...? That's ninja hand-to-hand combat... That being said...\Nhe's going to use weapons? Make-Out Paradise What's the matter? Why don't you come at me? But hey... what's with the book? Why do you ask...? It's because I was curious\Nabout what happens next. Don't worry. With you guys as opponents, it makes no difference\Nif I'm reading or not. I'm going to rip you apart! Darn! This time a spin kick! Man! Wha--?! Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them\Nfrom behind multiple times, fool. The way his hands are positioned... Is that the Sign of the Tiger?! No way! With Naruto as his opponent, that's too strong a Ninjutsu\Nno matter how you look at it. That Sign...\Nlt's a fire-style skill. That idiot teacher's doing more\Nthan just running around? Naruto, get out of there quick! You'll die! Too late. Leaf Village Secret!\NUltimate Taijutsu! One Thousand Years of Death! Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu. Those two are idiots. Alright... Even so, isn't that against the rules? What're we supposed to do\Nabout his strength? Darn it! It wasn't supposed to be\Nlike this. It... can't be! This is more than just a rumor. Kakashi's test might\Nbe a bit difficult... Even so, this means absolutely\Nno one has passed...! That's right... Kakashi has never had someone pass. They have all... been annihilated... What's the matter? You won't get lunch if you can't\Ntake the bell by noon. I know that, I say. You're not very energetic, considering you said that\Nyou'd surpass the Hokage. Darn it! Darn it!\NI can fight even if I'm hungry. I didn't even have dinner last night. I shouldn't have gone on a diet. I just got a bit careless earlier! Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength... But... I've got to take the bell,\Nno matter what. No matter what... I'm... not... turning back now! I'm going to become a Ninja! Security is your greatest enemy! Now for my favorite\NMulti-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Seven... Narutos? What? They're not just images? Are they all real?\NThe real thing? Not the clone,\Nbut the shadow clone, eh. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,\NI'll kill you! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox! Those aren't just images\Nbut actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu! It's the forbidden Jutsu\Nthat did in Mizuki. Judging from your ability, that Jutsu should have\Na one-minute limit. Even if you talk trash, Naruto is Naruto\Nafter all is said and done... You still can't beat me with that skill. W-What?! Behind me?! Ninja shouldn't let\Nthe enemy take them from behind. Right, Kakashi Sensei? Using the Shadow Clone, I had one of them come up from the bottom of the river\Nand sneak behind you! Here's one for that attack\Non my butt earlier! Naruto, not bad! So... a diversionary tactic, eh? Now... allow me to punch you! What?! The one who got punched was... Naruto? Ouch! You...! You're Kakashi Sensei, right?! You used the Transformation Jutsu\Nto change yourself, didn't you?! It's you! You're Kakashi Sensei, I say. You smell like Kakashi Sensei! The smell of an old guy! Why you--! Hey! For the time being,\Nlet's try undoing the Jutsu. If we do that,\Nonly the two will remain... so... You should've realized that sooner,\Nyou idiot! You're me, you idiot!\NJust undo the Jutsu! Naruto... You're embarrassing to watch... That was the Substitution Jutsu,\Nyou fool. Essentially, it's a skill used\Nto quickly switch one's own body with an object or animal. This makes your enemy think\Nyou're being attacked, but then you strike during\Ntheir unguarded moment. After letting himself get caught\Nby the real Naruto, the Jonin fool switched bodies\Nwith one of the clone Narutos. Not only did he make Naruto\Nthink he'd been nailed... he used Naruto's own attack on him. A bell?! You really must have been in a hurry. You've dropped a bell! What the heck is this?! Of course it's a trap... H-H-Hey! That jonin doesn't lower his guard\Neven when he's fighting Naruto. The bell! You have to think when using Jutsu. They can be used against you. Also... ...don't get caught in\Nan obvious trap, you fool. A Ninja must see\Nthrough deception! I know that, I say! You know, I'm telling you\Nbecause you don't get it. Listen up! Your movements are wasteful. Now! He finally dropped his guard! You're so... No way! You jerk Sasuke! You're overdoing it! Darn it! At this rate, there's no way\NI can beat Kakashi Sensei. But if I don't take the bell... I won't get lunch... No... I'll fail the test! He says a Ninja must see\Nthrough deception, but I have no idea what that means. How in the world can I take\Nthe bell back from Kakashi Sensei?! Next episode:\N ""You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision"" Don't miss my outstanding performance!",,,,0.0832190290093422,,,0.154509380653811,0.057319765457779996

Huh? Uh… Excuse me… Return of the Morning Mist My mother and my father…\NThey didn’t have to die. Because I didn’t have strength,\Nthe whole clan was destroyed. Everyone was killed… Darn it… Morning training is over! Once I’ve eaten breakfast I’ll get back to rigorous training! Old man… Konohamaru… Yo! Konohomaru. Naruto. Have you already resumed studies\Nat the academy? N-No, not yet. The school buildings are damaged,\Nso we’re all repairing them. Is that so? How about you, Naruto?\NYou’re already training? Sort of. Wh-What? What is it? N-No, it’s nothing… – Hey um…! 					– Hey um…! So what is it…? You too, Naruto, what is it? Nothing…really… I don’t feel lonely. Huh? There’s no time to be feeling lonely. Everyone is working really hard\Nto rebuild the village right now. Konohamaru… Right now, I must work for\Nthe village even just a little bit. So Naruto, you work hard\Nat your training too. If you don’t,\NI’ll become Hokage before you. Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage. Besides…you have to graduate\Nfrom the Academy first. Oh, that’s right… Oh, here it is. Here, it’s for you. A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku… Is it okay? I already have one,\Nso I’m giving one to you. Thank you, Naruto. Oh! Konohamaru. Good morning. I’m going to go. We’ll work hard again today. – Yep! 					– Yep! Today we’re fixing the blackboards. I brought paint. Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku,\NI’ll continue training. This is it. Th-This is… A lot of time has passed since the death. It’s probably before\Nthe Chunin Exam began. I see, so that's it… That Orochimaru! After the murder of Lord Kazekage, Orochimaru… or someone\Nlike Kabuto played Kazekage… How thoughtless we were… That darn Sarutobi… Well, it’s not that easy. The one who was your opponent\Nwas the renowned Hokage, deemed to be strongest of\Nall five great nations. However…you’ve done well.\NTwo out of the five Kages… Stop… Stop giving me words of sympathy. I will kill you! Of course, I didn’t mean to… It’s true that we didn’t succeed\Nin bringing the village down… On the other hand, another objective\Nof this plan, Sasuke Uchiha… Your leash is now on him. In exchange for these arms\Nand all of my Jutsu… If we could have gotten our hands\Non that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning, it wouldn’t have been a problem. However that’s a dream that\Ncan no longer come true. He is stronger than I am. That is why…I pulled myself out\Nfrom that organization… Kakashi, huh? What does he want? Breakfast, breakfast! Wait for me, my ramen. Do you already know\Nhis whereabouts? Yes. In that case, it will be easy… Let’s go. Here it comes, here it comes. Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought. Hidden Leaf Village…\Nhas a high average score. You’re still doing such\Na ridiculous thing? Well yes, this is my research. Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh? I wonder what you advisers\Nwant from me. Surely, you know… without our telling you, don’t you? You don’t have to make\Nsuch scary faces. I heard that the talks with Sand Village\Nhave been settled without problems. The Hidden Village in the Sand\Nannounced that everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork. In addition, at the moment of their\Ncomplete surrender to us, the Leaf Village, that wasn’t a very important issue\Nany more. Leaf Village has no choice but\Nto accept their surrender and proposition in order to restore national power. However, the current strength of\NLeaf Village has dropped drastically. Under these conditions, our top priority must be to prepare\Nfor any unpredicted crisis. We don’t know when any of\Nthe neighboring nations will come out in a bold move. Therefore, we’ve decided that until\Nthe village gets its strength back, we should assemble the top few men\Nfrom each troop, and form an emergency\Nexecutive committee to handle this. But first… we need a strong, trustworthy leader. You can find the seeds of trouble\Nrolling around everywhere these days. It’s not just Orochimaru. You didn’t have to go through\Nthe trouble of informing me that. Well… I’ll continue gathering materials. I’m going to tell you the basic plan. We need the Fifth Hokage right away. And yesterday at an emergency meeting\Nwith the feudal lord of the Land of Fire, we decided\Nit would be you, Jiraiya. I’m sorry, it’s not my nature. It has been decided. Besides, if a Shinobi like you,\Nrenowned as a Sannin, is not… then who is? If you want a Sannin,\Nthere is one more left… That Tsunade. Certainly that child probably\Nhas that capability, but… However, no one knows where she is. I’ll find and bring her back.\Nlf I do that there’s no problem, right? But… A wise one like Tsunade is meant to\Nbe Hokage more than I, with no motivation. What do you want to do? All right.\NWe’ll give it urgent consideration. However, we’ll have three members\Nfrom Anbu Black Ops to accompany you as the search unit for Tsunade. Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this.\NThe guards are not necessary. However… There is one guy that I want\Nto take with me on my trip. I’ve found an interesting egg… What? That is absolutely strange. Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket,\Nthere’s no ramen. No, wait a minute!\NI absolutely had one more. Huh? The one that I gave Konohamaru,\Nwas it the last? Welcome! Hey, my ramen! ""Racy Violence"" Yo, you two! You seem to be getting along well. Fool, Anko asked me to\Nbuy rice dumplings. That’s all. What are you doing here? While I’m here to buy offerings,\NI’ve made plans to meet here… with Sasuke. Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people. Is the offering to Obito? Obito? Well…that’s about right. Kakashi, it’s strange for\Nyou to be here first. Well… once in a while. I don’t do natto (fermented beans)\Nand sweet things. Oh… Is that so? What?! This is absolutely positively strange! You guys aren’t from the village…\NWhy in the world did you come? I haven’t seen you for\Na while Asuma, Kurenai. If you know about us,\Nare you former Leaf Shinobi? – Huh?! 					– Huh?! Y-You are?! Humph, without a doubt… Itachi… Uchiha. You are acquaintances of Itachi? If so… I’ll introduce myself as well. I’m Kisame Hoshigaki. Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you. Never mind later,\NI’m going to beat you now! Itachi… It seems you’re pretty unpopular\Nin the village too. I know you, too. Kisame Hoshigake, originally a Shinobi\Nof Hidden Village in the Mist. Suspected of national covert activities\Nand of killing a feudal lord, a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,\Non the wanted list in all nations. You’re a major S-rank criminal\Nlisted in the Bingo Book. Itachi, you have some nerve\Ncoming back to this village after causing that awful incident. Asuma… Kurenai… Don’t interfere with me. I don’t intend to kill you. That’s not a line for you,\Nwho killed your comrades. I know there’s no way\Nyou’d come here without any clear purpose\Nin those suspicious appearance. What are you after? This guy is pretty annoying.\NShould we kill him? It doesn’t look like we are able\Nto leave the village so smoothly… But don’t overdo it,\Nyour techniques tend to stand out. They're done for then. This is… Genjutsu. Pressing down with the tip of his sword…\NWhat strength. My large sword, Shark Skin… doesn’t cut, but lops it off! Kurenai… You’re late. With this… it’s over! Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me. This is…Genjutsu Reversal? Kurenai! There’s no time to look away. That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai. But… “But” this is as far as it goes… for you. What?! Water Style! – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!\N– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! The same Jutsu as me?! Why have you shown up too? Well…I asked you to take care\Nof them earlier. But I kinda felt uneasy, you know. Shadow clones. Kakashi… Hatake. Cripes… So much fuss for nothing. I… I put it under my headband in order not to drop the important ticket\Nduring morning training. Okay, that’s fine…\NEat well and do your best. Hmm? You’re going to do it again\Nafter this, right? Training? Of course! I’m full of motivation. Good! Here you go. Another serving for free! Go for it! Thank you, sir! Welcome. Just like I heard…\NI had to come and see it. It seems that you really\Nare just eating ramen. Oh, Pervy Sage! A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up\Nis the dream we've chosen, right? It's a secondary role, a role in the shadows But in reaching for that dream, let us stay centered,\Nlet us stay true Over and over,\Nwe hung on without giving up Over and over,\Nwe kept coming back up Over and over,\Nwe believed and dreamed Over and over,\Nwe've seen fools Itachi Uchiha… who became a leader of\NAnbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen and who destroyed\Nthe Uchiha clan single-handedly.

What?! I want to fight, too.\NEven I can-- No, you won’t! Like that four-eyed kid said, right? You’re on a different level.

Hi. – Huh?! 					– What is this?! – Wha--?!\N– What the heck’s going on?! Long time no see. On account of the drug, Master Jiraiya still can’t build up\NChakra very well. It looks like your stupid\Nstill hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya. That’s too much even for you\Nwith no ability. It seems Tsunade got you\Nwith something. A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu, so perhaps she was thinking ahead\Nand drugged him with something that\Nwould contain his power. To think she’d make\Na sacrifice of Jiraiya… Well, it sounds just like Tsunade. To think I’d already have\Nmy handicap spotted. You are such\Na disgraceful guy as always… Dang it. It kind of ticks me off\Nwhen the Pervy Sage is mocked. Summoning…Jutsu! The Nine-Tailed Fox kid\Nfrom the Chunin Exam. I wonder if I should’ve killed him then,\Nafter all. For the sake of the Akatsuki organization, I acknowledged his achievement…\Nand let him slide by. But the only ones who can break\Na Five-Pronged Spell are the Sannin members\Nand the Third Hokage. Which means Jiraiya may have\Nalready taught it to Naruto. Perhaps. If he’s able to control\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s power… Oh… Th-This is… It doesn’t quite look to be so. He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability\Nto begin with, so… Why? He’s still got a long way to go,\Nsure enough. Why?! Hello. Hey, Gamatatsu.\NWhy did you come out? Oh, Brother Gamakichi. It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned. I-I wonder if I can do my best? Idiot. Get some snacks\Nor something and hide. What? I can get snacks?\NGoody-goody. Here I go. I’ll take Jiraiya. I leave the rest to you. It’s unfortunate… Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,\None of the Sannin. Naruto! Your opponent is me. Earth Style! Dark Swamp! Dang it. I can’t completely sink them\Nwith such a puny swamp. The drug is still working. But…with this, the snakes can’t move. Ninja Art! Poison Fog! I’ll be up a creek if\NI take even one breath. My leg tendons…! I won’t be eaten twice…!\NNo way! Here I go. Ninja Art! Needle Jizo! Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well. Even if we both have handicaps,\Nyou won’t one-up me… Give up now. It’s unfortunate… Here I had respected you\Nas a fellow Medical Ninja. Stop. Stay back! Please hang on, Lady Tsunade… The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru\Nis also called, will cry. My body’s heavy. To think you who were\Nonce called the village madness would ferry around such a kid\Nand struggle tirelessly for the village. You’ve really fallen, haven’t you? I have a keen eye to discern ability. And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes. It’s precisely for this reason…\Nthat I don’t need the Uchiha kid. It’s no fun raising a genius\Nwho’s good from the start. So you can’t leave him alone because it’s like you’re looking\Nat your old self? That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited\Nthe inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill. And that’s because Naruto\Ndoesn’t possess the Sharingan. Shinobi ability is about whether one can use and master\Nall the Jutsu of the world. Ninja refers to one\Nwho can use Ninjutsu. Shinobi ability is no such thing. You still don’t get it? A Ninja…is one who endures. It’s a difference of opinion, huh. I’ll teach you one thing. What’s most important for Shinobi ability… isn’t the number of Jutsu\None possesses. What’s important is… The mettle… not to give up. Enough already…you jerk! The mettle to never give up… He possesses that. Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned, but you can’t hit me with\Nsuch a large motion. No good. It won’t easily hit with\Na moving opponent. Owwee! And the Chakra isn’t\Ncompletely held, yet… It seems you got a cracked thigh bone\Nin your left leg from the battle with the snake. Well, you can still move if\Nit’s just the bone. But it’s impossible now… The lateral vastus muscle\Nin your right leg is totally cut off. What should I do…? That Jutsu of mine uses both hands. If even one arm is taken out, it’s over. Are you scared of me? Do you want to run away from here? Naruto, as I recall, you whooped it up like this\Nduring the first Chunin Exam. Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away! ""Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away."" ""I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…"" ""I’ll become the Hokage at any cost,\Nso it’s okay with me."" ""I’m not scared."" Can you…\Nwhoop it up in the same way now? Unlike you… I will be the heir to the Hokage name\Nno matter what! – Hokage is my dream!\N– Hokage is my dream! You’re not a kid anymore,\Nso you should stop whooping it up… Depending on the situation, when you want to give up and run away,\Nyou should run away. Oh my… What’s with that look? You’ll die! If you die,\Nthere are no dreams or anything… Do you want to die? You’re still a Genin,\Nso you should run away on the battlefield. Don’t tell a man to run away. Kids think that everything is easy. That’s why they talk about foolish dreams\Nlike nothing at all. That’s why they can’t give up. Jiraiya, was it you\Nwho taught him that Rasengan? Are you acting like a teacher by teaching\Na Jutsu that can’t be learned? Don’t give him false hopes. That’s why a moony kid starts joking\Nthat he’ll become the Hokage! They chase after foolish dreams…\Nand then die. If I have three days,\NI’ll master that Jutsu. Then let's make a bet. Bastard! As for me… I stand by my words. That’s…my Way of Ninja! A bet? I’ll give you one week. If you can master that Jutsu, I’ll acknowledge that\Nyou’ll be able to become the Hokage… and give you this necklace. You should’ve just\Nstayed out of this… Why? Why?! Old Lady Tsunade… You’re still going to get up? Just like our wager I will definitely win\Nthat unlucky necklace from you. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone won’t do anything now. Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto.\NStop it! I told you that you’d die\Nif you were obstinate like that, right? If you die, there will be no dreams,\Nno nothing. Just get out of the way. Run away. Humph… It’s okay. I… I absolutely will not die… until I become the Hokage! This way, I can hold on to you.\NHere I go! It’s the same Chakra movement\Nas before. No, this is…different. I see. In order to gain a hand\Nfor suppressing Chakra, the Shadow Clone… Compress Chakra and… hold it completely. Wha--?! I-It can’t be. Rasengan!

3,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Today's…a special day, so… Time to eat! Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes? Fight me, here! What're you doing, Konohamaru? Very good, Naruto… You're the man I expected you to be. I didn't do anything, you know… Let's fight fair! Sorry! I've got\Nan orientation meeting to go to. An orientation meeting…? Cause… As of today, I'm a Ninja! Oh… Sakura!\NShouldn't you be heading out soon? I was thinking of leaving now! Cha! How long are you planning\Nto treat me like a child?! That's right… I'm not a student\Nof the academy anymore… I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village,\NSakura Haruno! I'm off! Morning, Sakura. Morning... Ino. Who would've thought you'd\Nbe able to graduate. Ancient history has nothing to do with it. As of today,\Nwe're both full-fledged Ninjas... I won't lose to you anymore, Ino! What the--? Why are you here? Today's meeting is for graduates only. Hey, don't you see this headband? As of today, I'm a Ninja, too! How can I put it, it really suits me. So Naruto…was able to graduate. Goal! I won again, Sakura! What're you saying…? The tip of my foot got in\None centimeter faster! You must be blind. It's Sakura. Oh… Sakura's looking at me… Hey, Sakura! Mor... morning, Sakur-- Get outta' the way! M-Morning, Sasuke… Mind if I sit next to you? Hey! I'm going to sit\Nnext to Sasuke! First come, first served! I got in the classroom sooner! I did! If that's the case,\Nthen I did! I was first! I'm sitting next to Sasuke! How annoying... Is that this year's top rookie,\NSasuke Uchiha? Yes. The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan? Yes. Naruto Uzumaki, eh… Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke! Sakura… Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke. What's so great about this guy?! Just beat him up, Sasuke! Yeah! Yeah! What? Really? Oh! Sorry! Wha--? Whoa! Cha! I was planning on\Nseizing Sasuke's first kiss! You jerk…\NNaruto! I'll kill you! – My mouth is rotting.\N– Huh? Was that my fault? What? I feel rage… Naruto… You… An accident…\Nlt was an accident You are annoying! Yikes! Naruto…He's at\Nthe center of trouble as usual. As of today, you all have become\Nfull-fledged Ninjas… However, you're still Genin. The tough part's still to come! From here on, you'll be in a squad of three and carry out your missions\Nunder your Jonin teachers. A squad of three?! I wonder who's going to be\Ngrouped with Sasuke. I don't know… Cha! I'll be the one grouped\Nwith Sasuke, naturally! Squads of three, eh.\Nlt'll just slow me down… First will be Sakura. And the other person… can be anyone other than Sasuke! The groups have been determined so that the strength of\Nthe groups will be balanced. Now for the assignments! Now then, next is Group Seven… Naruto Uzumaki! Sakura Haruno. Hooray! I'm with…Naruto…? And…Sasuke Uchiha! Hooray! I'm with…Sasuke…? So I'll be in a different group\Nfrom Naruto, huh… Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga! Y-Yes… Kiba Inuzuka! Shino Aburame! Why is this happening…? Group Nine. Cha! Love will be victorious! Man… Why do women think that\Nkind of guy's so great…? Don't you understand, Shikamaru? Well, I'm not a woman… That's why you are\Nnot popular among girls. I wouldn't want to be grouped with you. Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.\N Shikamaru Nara. It appears we've been\Ngrouped together. And Choji Akimichi. And Fatty on top of that... That's all for the group division. Iruka Sensei! Why does an exceptional student\Nlike me have to be in the same group with this guy?! Sasuke has the best grades\Nof the graduates. Naruto, you're at the bottom! Of course, this is how it is when trying\Nto balance the strength within groups. Just don't get in my way, loser! Hey, what did you say?! You want to fight, loser? Knock it off, Naruto!! In the afternoon,\NI'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers. You're dismissed until then! Sasuke! Where'd you go, Sasuke? I thought since we're in the same group\Nand all, we'd eat together. Sakuraaaa! Since we're in the same group and all,\Nlet's eat together! Why should I have to eat with you?! Well... we're in the same group, so… You're…annoying. Sasuke! Where are you? Darn! This is no fun. I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura…\Nand then it's like this… I wonder if something good will happen… That's it! Listen up! As long as we're in the same group,\Nyou will follow my instructions. Yeah-yeah… She becomes a real pain in the neck\Nwhen people try to argue with to her, so… Let's all go out for\Nsome BBQ sometime. Oh, man… Hmm? Naruto…? Huh? Oh! Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it! Darn! Just be quiet. Naruto! I won't forgive you\Nif you hurt Sasuke! What happened? Heh! Idiot… So Naruto got beaten by\Nthe one he challenged… Of course! Naruto's no match\N for Sasuke! No need for me to feel rushed… From here on out, I'll be in the same group as\NSasuke for the long haul… But… Even if I were to use\Nmy feminine charms… my proportions are below average… All that's above average is\N the width of my forehead… What should I do…? Huh? No way! Sasuke…is looking... this way! And with such a passionate look! You…have a charmingly wide forehead. It makes me want to kiss it. That's what its surface area is for. Yeah, right… I'm not just some kid\Nwho believes in fairy tales… There's no way. You…have a charmingly wide forehead. What?! It makes me want to kiss it. Cha! This fairy tale is for real!! Or that's what Naruto would say. I've got something to ask you. What? What do you think…of Naruto? He's quite at home interfering and\Nenjoys it when I make mistakes. Naruto doesn't understand\None thing about me… He just annoys me! All I want…is for you to\Naccept me, Sasuke.… For me to accept you…? I'll do anything for the sake of that. I was careless! W-Wha--?! Gotcha! I didn't think someone who couldn't\Nperform the Clone Jutsu properly could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu. I'm…desperate, so… I finally know why I… I like Sakura so much. Diarrhea at a time like this?! What's wrong? I-I'll be right back…\N225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04\NSasuke's so shy! I guess he needs to\Nprepare himself mentally… That was close! My stomach hurt so much that\Nthe Jutsu was about to wear off! Why does my stomach have\Nto hurt at such a good time?! I'm annoying... huh… She said so again… And I transformed into Sasuke and\Nhad got a little closer to Sakura… In that case…\NI'll play an obnoxious Sasuke … and make her hate him! Oh Sasuke,\Nyou're such a shy bad boy! Are you prepared? I'm raring to go! H-Hey, Sasuke! Where's Naruto? Oh, there you go changing\Nthe subject again… Just leave Naruto alone! All he does is pick fights with you! It's because he wasn't raised right! You know! He doesn't have any parents, right? He always selfishly does\N whatever he wants! My parents would get mad at me\Nif I did something like that! There are no parents to nag you\Nif it's just you alone! So his selfishness comes\Nout at various times! The loneliness. Huh? It's something worse than getting\Nscolded by parents and... W-What's gotten into you…? You… annoy me. Darn! It finally stopped! I wonder if Sakura's still waiting. W-What are you doing here?! I used the Escape Jutsu,\Nthe very basic of techniques. Oh... What were you planning to do… by transforming into me?! I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try! The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?! I'll show you that I'm really amazing! I'll defeat you… and make you accept me! Prepare yourself, Sasuke! Just like that, my stomach again… B-Bathroom! I'm first, I say! I'm first, I say. I'm about to go in my pants, I say! How stupid! ""You annoy me"" …huh? I see. So this is how\NNaruto must've felt… I wonder if I can…\Nbe a bit more nice next time… Darn. Did I eat something bad? Naruto… Smile…Smile… Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto. Sakura… Payback for earlier, huh? Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura… You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?! I don't think so! Ow-ow-ow…\NWhat the heck is going on?! Oh… You idiot, Naruto! So, this is Naruto's room… And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is\N also in the group you'll be in charge of. I wish you good luck! The expiration date… of this milk has passed quite awhile ago… He'll get sick if he drink this. It seems like that things are\Ngoing to get disastrous. What the heck is going on?! What is going on?! This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei\Nfrom yesterday. Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei who got caught in my trap\Nand breezily came late? Darn it! Darn it! No way am I giving up!

If I do that,\Nthere’d be the possibility for me, after the first battle,\Nto be able to fight Sasuke. I know your Sand attack. I wonder which is faster,\Nyours or my Sound. In the full moon… in the full moon, his blood boils. W-What the heck…are you? Amazing… So that’s his true form? But…is it okay?\NHe’s a Sound Ninja … It’s all right.\NHe’s long since served his purpose. I thought he was a guinea pig\Nin order to see… the power of the boy\Ncalled Sasuke or something… Why…is he with the Sand Ninja? No, that’s not necessary anymore… Actually, I’d already been ordered\Nto seize Sasuke. But I failed… What did you say? That’s right. …for the likes of you? Are you looking to take me on? You willful little brat…\NDon’t mess around with grown-ups. Don’t be so arrogant.\NThe situation is in my favor. It’s also been found out that\NI’m a minion of the Sound. Then…if they find out that you’re\Nhaving a secret meeting here with me… the plan to destroy the Leaf Village\Nand everything will be for naught! I heard…\Nthat you’re Orochimaru’s right-hand man. Being revealed to them and coming\Nnonchalantly to meet with me… You must be a fool. Well…to be exact, my true identity\Nwasn’t found out… I let them find out. I wanted to see how far\Nthe Leaf Village would go… Even after that it wouldn’t\Nbe too late to seize Sasuke. If you guys are going to fail,\Nwe’ll back off immediately… It’s a plan that was originally\Nposed by the Sound, so. The Sand is invisible until\Nthe last moment. This is the will of the Kazekage. Holy smokes… That’s fine. This is the carry-out plan from Sound. Okay. And please…tell them about\Nthis plan soon. Yeah. I know. Okay, I’ll be going. To think our allied nation,\Nthe Village Hidden in the Sand, has been already associated\Nwith the Sound…?! I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick. Oh, by the way… I’ll take care of the clean up. No, I’ll do it… As the member of Sand Village\Nof the Land of Wind, I must do what I can for my allies… Besides…it’s just one mouse. It’ll be easy. Well well, it’s Mr. Proctor. What in the world are you\Ndoing here alone? It seems I have no choice,\N but to fight. Leaf Style… Crescent  Moon Dance! I can’t pull it out. This technique is…\Nthe Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance. Being able to manage it\Nat such a young age. As expected,\Nthis village is full of talented Ninja. Your talent with a sword is superb. But, a real sword with substance\Ncan be stopped. However…a Wind sword can’t\Nbe stopped by anyone. Take that! That does it! Nice, nice. Hey… This is paradise. Hey, I said. Isn’t it time for you to turn\Nthis way already? If you join my training,\NI’ll give you lots of “service.” P-l-e-a-s-e. So you finally came out…\NI was waiting for you. What?! Are you making fun of me? Right back at you. I’m hungry. Let’s get back to the inn. Owww, darn it! Okay…I’ll teach you a technique. Do you really mean that? Do you remember what I told you\Nyesterday about the two types of Chakra? Huh? Yesterday’s talk? You know, what you said about blue\Nand red Chakra or something. Oh… What about it? You said that when a great power\Ncame out, you felt red Chakra. Yeah, it was like that. Try building up that red Chakra right now. Hmm. Even you say so… I’ll give it a try, but… How about it? Hmm, it’s not right. It’s the same Chakra as always. Jeez, you have no talent. Don’t be talking all high and mighty! In the first place, I really don’t understand those\Ntwo types of Chakra myself! Just keep trying. Humph… So he doesn’t understand it…\Nhimself, eh. It seems Naruto himself still hasn’t\Nrealized that the red Chakra is\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra. Well, guessing from his story… it seems the excitement of danger\Nand heightened emotion are the key to summon\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra. No good, not good. Only the usual Chakra’s coming out. Say, Pervy Sage… What the heck does the red Chakra and\Nthe technique you’re going to teach me have to do with each other? Listen, boy. For the technique\NI’m about to teach you, the Chakra you’ve had until now\Nis not nearly enough. Therefore, you’ll have to able to\Npull out and use the “other” Chakra that has been dormant within\Nyou at any time you need. But how do you know that\NI have such a Chakra? Oh, just what I wanted to hear. Actually… it’s because I’m a sage. Jeez…that’s no answer. Anyway, the special Chakra\Nthat only you have will become your greatest weapon. Greatest weapon? Not using that is like wasting treasure. There’s no need to forcedly do\Nthe same training as everyone else. Everyone has what they’re good at\Nand poor at. You have your own style. Your training until now, maintaining\Nand releasing a set amount of Chakra, was in other words, training to control the suppression of\NChakra so that you wouldn’t get exhausted. But you who have a lot of stamina should be about power rather\Nthan a cheap trick. You, who has two types of Chakra\Nand doesn’t exhaust easily, should release the largest amount\Nof Chakra you can and train to increase the absolute amount\Nof Chakra that you can use. Then there are tons of Jutsu\Nand techniques you can use. What, for example? For example…summoning Jutsu\Nthat I’m going to teach you now. Summoning? Right. It’s a type of spatio-temporal technique where you sign a contract in blood\Nwith all kinds of living creatures and summon whenever you like\Nwith Ninjutsu. Oh! That sounds awesome.\NTeach me quick! Before that… first, it’s necessary to\Nuse up all of your usual Chakra. Okay! Leave it to me. Well… So you can use the\NShadow Clone Jutsu. I have a good idea how to get rid\Nof my Chakra quickly. Well, you’ve multiplied quite a bit. Listen up. We’re going to have\Na battle royal now. The last one left will be\Nthe strongest me… We’re going to determine\Nthe me among me! – Yeah! 					– Yeah! I see.\NGood thinking considering he’s stupid. Okay, let’s go! My, this is a sexually unattractive scene. The finale is near at last. Well done. Sure enough, I’m the strongest me. It looks like you’ve finally used up\Nalmost all of your Chakra. Now, at last I’ll teach you\Nthe technique. Oh, I’ve been waiting! First, I’ll show you. Watch carefully. Summoning Jutsu! Ooh, so cool. Open that scroll. It’s a contract with the\Nsummoning toads that I’ve taken over from generations. Sign your name in your own blood and stamp the fingerprints of one hand\Nin blood under that. Then build up Chakra in the place\Nyou want to summon and set down the hand you contracted. The Sign is\NBoar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep. NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI. Okay…This is fine, right? It’s easier for you to release\Nred Chakra right now. So give it a try. I already am. Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep. Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu. A tadpole… This kid…has no talent, after all. Hayate…what in the world happened? One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two! He kisses and hugs everyone\Nrandomly and says “I LOVE YOU” Three! Masala masters Yoga\Nbut hates curry Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole! All over the world, the sky’s smiling,\Nso look up and smile too Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!\NFight! Fight! Fight! One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes\Nhis time for digging black ships Two!

Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something The Three Villains from\N                    the Maximum Security Prison All right! I can start my training! Right now, this is all I can do.\NI can’t allow myself to fail! What’s up? Going to all the trouble of coming\Nto pick me up like this… You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s\Nafter this anyway, right…? Taking the time to converse\Nonce in a while… that’s also part of teamwork. Let me hear about your mission. It was pretty incredible… But you wouldn’t understand\Neven if I explained it to you. I don’t want Akamaru to experience\Nthat kind of thing ever again. And for that reason, I must polish\Nmy Jutsu all the more… I want to hear about it in detail. Because that’s what teamwork\Nis about. Are you sulking ‘cause you were the only one\Nwho was passed up? You are sulking, aren’t you? There have to be more further up… Until I can see it… I can’t believe you’re doing\Nthat from the morning… Neji, let’s take a break. Okay! – Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay! Father, see you later. Barbecued meat?\NThis early in the morning, huh? Just when he was looking good\Nafter losing some weight when he was released\Nfrom the hospital. He made an amazing rebound,\Ndidn’t he? With that good an appetite, there aren’t any more worries\Nabout his health, are there? When I’m done eating,\Nhelp me with my training, okay? Asuma Sensei! Hey, are you an idiot\Nor something?! You’re recuperating, you know! L-Lee… Come on,\Nlet’s take a short break… What’s the matter, Guy Sensei? The prime of one’s youth waits\Nfor no one, you know. Maintaining the prime of one’s youth\Nis starting to get tough… Thank you very much! Do your best, guys… I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by\Nthe next time you’re here! M-Me too… I want to become a Kunoichi\Njust like you, Temari… I’m honored. I apologize for asking you\Nto teach at the Academy… since we’re so short-staffed right now. You probably would've preferred\Nto go sightseeing or something. No problem.\NI’m doing this because I enjoy it. Yeah… And we were also able to survey the future potential of\Nthe Leaf’s military power… Well, be careful going home. Okay… If something happens again,\NI’ll come to your rescue again. Just let me know, crybaby. You always say too much.\NThat’s why girls are… Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru! All right, everybody’s here right? You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata… Y-Yeah… All right! Everybody stand ready! I can’t…lose to Naruto…! All right! I’m ready! I just have to wait\Nfor Pervy Sage to come--! There he is! But my training… Don’t get so pouty, Naruto. Some work came in all of a sudden.\Nlt can’t be helped. It’s just gonna be doing\Nan interview for some obscene magazine\Nanyway, right? That kind of thing isn’t called work. It’s a mission to gather information\Nabout the Akatsuki Organization. But if I tell this guy that, he might ask me to\Nlet him come. Humph! I’ll make it up to you by… Huh? W-What’s this? It’s so that you don’t get bored\Nwhile you’re staying at home, it’s a special training menu\NI put together! Wow! Wait, wait! My own prized secret training\Nmethods are inscribed here. Don’t read this where\Nother people might see it! Okay! Well, do your best! I’m gonna use this\Nto train vigorously! Thank you, Pervy Sage! The walls have ears…\Npaper doors have eyes… Pervy Sage’s secret training methods… WILLPOWER What?! Pervy Sage! Since I have been entrusted with the great Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves that you built, no matter what danger might strike,\Nit is my duty to protect it. The Hokage sure has it tough, huh. Yes, you really do. Is that you, Shizune?\NEnter! All of these reports regarding\Nthe village’s internal affairs accumulated because so many things\Nwere happening in the Leaf Village. I guess the only thing to do\Nis start at the top. Leaf Maximum Security Facility. Did its name change? Yes, in the past\Nit was called Prison Specializing in\NCapital Offenses Ninja. Fortunately, because there\Nis a downward trend in felonies committed by Shinobi, along with the downsizing of the facility,\Nthe name was changed as well. Incarcerated are murderers, those who were involved in\Nleaking classified secrets, and so on. They are all criminal Ninja… There haven’t been any noticeable\Ndisruptions in the past few years and the facility has been\Nrelatively stable. – Food! 					– Food! It’s finally time to eat,\Nisn’t it, Elder Brother! Yeah! I’m so excited! Hey! Fujin! Raijin! If you don’t shut up,\Nyou’re gonna go without dinner! Gimme a break! Those guys… You may pass! Hey! Wait! You’re hurt, aren’t you? Go to the dispensary later\Nand have that looked at. Okay… All right, next! H-Hey, Elder Brother… Huh? Why is the little finger\Nshort and weak? That’s easy, Raijin. If the little finger was thick and strong, then your thumb would\Nhave no leg to stand on. I-I see! Elder Brother…Elder Brother…! – Huh? 					– A lizard! Raijin, you’ve always been\Na dandy one from way back. W-We haven’t had enough to eat,\Nhave we, Elder Brother? Yeah… Not asking permission again… What’s the matter? What’s up this time? I’m starving… G-Give us something to eat! Oh no… If these guys find out\NI don’t have anything…! Um…right now… Don’t tell me that\Nyou don’t have even one offering… to these Fujin and\NRaijin brothers?! Well…wait…wait…! What do you think? Tastes good, huh? I’ll bring you something else later! Right now make do with that! – Okay! 					– Okay! Are you okay? Those guys are quiet\Nwhen they have food. But if they get angry\Nthey’re out of control. Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades\Nover food during a mission and the people around just barely\Nmanaged to hold them down. Something smells good?! Yeah. This way! – Food! Food! Food!\N– Food! Food! Food! I just can’t get to liking clerical work. There’s still a whole lot more to do,\NLady Tsunade. I wonder what this is? It looks like a formula\Nfor some kind of medicine… A formula… Send an available Jonin here\Nimmediately! Yes, ma’am? Hurry! Y-Yes, ma’am! How about it…\NDoes it taste good? I see…I see…\NThere’s still a whole lot more. Just as I thought, that good smell was coming\Nfrom your place, Elder Brother! Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother\Nalways has delicious food! It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it? ’Cause I’d feel so sorry\Nif you guys had to go hungry. Elder Brother… – A lizard! 					– A lizard! I see, I see…Happy? How about it, you guys? Don’t you want to eat things\Nthat are even more delicious? W-Where are they at?! If we go to the place where\Nan old friend of mine is… you can pig out on food\Nthat’s even more delicious than here. Is that the guy you told us\Nabout long time ago, Elder Brother? Yeah, Lord Orochimaru… Gimme a break…\Nthat guy’s gotta be kidding! That Pervy Sage… just leaving me and\Nmy training up in the air! Come on, don’t say that, Naruto. Master Jiraiya had a mission too. Heh! It’s probably that\NLady Tsunade decided that only Master Jiraiya\Ncould do the job… It can't be helped. Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s\Ndoing, after all, huh! Well, I guess all I can do is treat you\Nto some ramen noodles like this. So cheer up. I’m gonna go complain\Nto Old Lady Tsunade! Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei! N-Naruto! Damn… another annoying situation. Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?! This is about a year ago, a Chunin Academy staff member\Nused Naruto to sneak out\Nthe Scroll of Sealing. According to the report, it was\Na crime committed by Mizuki acting alone. The crime was solved, but…? Yeah, if it really was him acting alone. The possibility has arisen that\Na bigger mastermind is behind this crime. This is a clue… This is something that Mizuki\Nwas concealing when he was incarcerated\Nin the Maximum Security Facility. At the time, nobody thought of it\Nas anything more than a doodle. Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway? I don’t know, however… The handwriting resembles\Nthe document confiscated from the facility where Orochimaru was conducting\Nhuman experiments… Which means that…\NOrochimaru is connected to this crime?! The possibility of that is not zero. It’s not like a Chunin alone could do\Nanything with the Scroll of Sealing. It would only make sense if Orochimaru\Nwere pulling strings from behind. Asuma! Kurenai! Go immediately to the Maximum\NSecurity Facility and interrogate Mizuki! Orochimaru?! Be careful! Something’s strange here! Yeah… It’s too quiet. Let’s go! Oh, how touching.\NA welome party for us… Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.\NRight, Elder Brother? Yeah… Asuma, don’t tell me that\Nthose guys are… Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers… Fujin and Raijin! Asuma… Hey, you guys are whooping it up\Ntoo much for a welcome party! Hey, calm down…\Nthe welcome party’s just started. His character has changed completely… All you jerks… You will…be our offering! Do it! Orochimaru! Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!

Should you really be worrying\Nabout others right now? He’s fast! And what’s more, such power… So this is the power Lord Orochimaru\Nwas talking about… Amazing… It’s almost scary… Don’t you agree, Iruka? Mizuki, please stop. Please…! Tsubaki… I don’t care what happens\Nto me… I just don’t want you to\Ncommit any more crimes. Please! Return to the village. Tsubaki… If you care that much\Nabout me, then you could at least\Nbe useful to me! Tsubaki…! What?! You’re so slow. Iruka Sensei…! Damn! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Hasty as always, huh… You sure haven’t made\Nany progress, have you? He vanished! He didn’t vanish.\NHe’s just fast. That guy’s been accelerating since earlier\Nand moving into our blind spots… In that case… Everybody, better be very aware\Nof your surroundings!

In that case… I want to watch you experience\Neven deeper despair… Despair that’s equal to that wisdom\Nyou’ve managed to muster! There he is! I see him! It’s not that you saw me. I’m going out of my way\Nto show myself to you. There! Damn… Even though I can see him,\NI‘m unable to land any blows. I’m telling you, I’m not foreseeing\Nyour movements. You’re just sluggish. Oww… Hey, serves you right. You demon fox. Don’t be so delighted in such\Na big way. You’ll now get a taste of\Nthe same agony I have endured. Starting now, right, Naruto? There’s still much more\Nto come! Stop that, Mizuki!\NDon’t lay your hands on Naruto! Shut up, Iruka! Do you have any idea how much\NI’ve been waiting for this moment? I’ve been waiting for this day\Never since then. For this time of revenge. I will use this power of mine and take my own good time\Nto crush each of you, one at a time. Come on, stand up, Iruka.\NI’ll start by killing this guy. Mizuki…! There you go. 					That’s good! Come on! You are pathetic. There’s a world of difference\Nbetween us, isn’t there? I’ve gotten my hands on\Nthis extreme body and it is your fate\Nto die wretchedly. What do you mean,\N ""extreme body""? When your power depends\Non potions, it’s not true power! That sounds just like\Nthe half-baked guy you are… In that case, go ahead\Nand try winning… Using that real power\Nyou’re talking about! I’m different from you.\NYou're gonna live out your life… as some lowly teacher who never thinks\N about getting ahead in life, who only gets used by the village\Nin whatever way they see fit. How do you like…this power…\Nand the way I carry myself?! Even if you trained\Na hundred years, you'll never be able\Nto earn it! I’m not gonna stop here! I’m still gonna get much\Nmuch stronger… I’ll get Orochimaru to share\Nhis Hidden Jutsu with me. Do you really think that will happen? I’m getting tired of you\Nplaying the martyr. I think it’s about time\Nto end this. Isn’t this nostalgic…? This time, I’ll get you for sure. So prepare yourself. Naruto! You jerk! Don’t you dare lay\Nyour hands on Iruka Sensei! This is really something! Every little thing is exactly the same\Nas it was that other time. But I’ve changed. The reason for my defeat\Nthat time… was that I let my guard down\Nto the demon fox that you are. Wh-What’s that?! I won’t let my guard down again. I’ll call upon all my strength\Nto beat you down! Bring it on! I’m sorry…both of you… Choji! Damn… If only I had a little more\Ninformation about those guys… Elder Brother…\NMy body feels lighter. Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter,\Ndoesn’t it? Okay, time for clobbering… Yeah! Clobbering! There they come. Damn it! Huh? What the hell is this?! M-My body… Doesn’t move…! Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis? Looks like I made it in time. Good work!\NShikamaru, Ino, Choji! Leave the rest to me! The F-Fifth Hokage! No way…\NLady Hokage…in person?! Lady Tsunade. I’m sorry I found out\Nabout this so late. But I wouldn’t have imagined that these guys were\Nhanging out with Mizuki… Fifth Hokage! We are saved…! Uh…uh…Elder Brother… Oh…Oh… Well, we run into each other\Nin unusual places, don’t we, Fujin and Raijin? T-Tsunade… Let me ask what\Nyou’re doing here. Powerful. More like, scary. Now then, is there something\Nyou want to say? I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.\NWe’ll never do it again! So you guys went with Mizuki\Nbecause he told you that you’d be able to eat something good\Nat Orochimaru’s place? – I’m, I’m sorry.\N– I’m, I’m sorry. No way we could stand up to guys on the\Nsame level as the Three Legendary Ninja. But I wonder what happened\Nbetween them the past… to make those two that scared. No thanks. I don’t even want\Nto imagine what it might be. Gimme a break.\NFalling for such an obvious bait! Mizuki has apparently gone\Ninto those mountains up ahead. Naruto and Iruka are probably\Nwith him… You guys come along\Nafter recuperating a little. Huh…wait a minute. What are we going to do\Nwith these two guys? Huh? You don’t need\Nto worry about that… More importantly, I can’t let them\Ncause any more trouble. I’ve decided to make these guys\Ngo home on their own. Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume\Nyou understand this already, but if you’re even one minute late\Nyou’re not getting any dinner. – Yes, ma’am! 					– Yes, ma’am! We can’t be doing this, Raijin. Let’s hurry back to the institution. Elder Brother, dinner, right?! Dinner! – Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…\N– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner… Amazing…\Nwhat incredible speed. It’s very important for\Na person to eat, after all. That’s just you. Damn! His power is\Neven greater than earlier! But I can’t let him\Ntake me down. This guy may have a lead\Nto Sasuke’s whereabouts. Naruto! Iruka, are you all right? Yes... Did you notice? What? Although that jerk’s power\Nhas increased multifold, the sharpness of his movements\Nis diminishing. Huh? Did he transfer the Chakra\Nhe was using for speed, to power? I don’t really know that, but… That’s quite a heavy burden\Nfor Naruto to bear alone. But if that guy’s speed\Nhas diminished, there might be a chance to win. All right… You hang in there\Na little bit more, Naruto! How about this,\Nyou little brat? Do you like the power of this body\Nthat Lord Orochimaru gave me! I’ll tear you apart. Where the hell is he…? That Orochimaru…\NWhere is he? Why would I tell a little brat\Nlike you that kind of thing? He wasn’t in\Nthe Village Hidden in the Sound. The Village Hidden in the Sound?\NDid you go there?! The compound was\Nalready totally empty… Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru\Nwas there anymore. You really gave that one\Na lot of thought for a guy like you, huh… I don’t know where you heard that\Nabout the Village Hidden in the Sound… but if you’re trying to fluster me\Nby talking rubbish like that, it’s not gonna happen. Give up ‘cause you’re going\Nto the next world. Listen carefully. Don’t you dare talk\Nthat kind of trash again! Naruto, this way. Iruka Sensei… Just try to catch me! You jerk…don’t even think\NI’m gonna let you get away! Now! Jump up, Naruto! All right!! Damn…this is…! Seal and Capture Perimeter! The Capture and Arrest Jutsu! Rasengan! Naruto, that Jutsu is… So that’s the Fourth Hokage’s\NJutsu… Rasengan… Are you all right, Iruka Sensei? Naruto, that was spectacular.\NGood work! Listen Sensei… It looks like this guy didn’t know\Nabout the Village Hidden in the Sound. So I was thinking that he’s no longer…\Nwith Orochimaru… Don’t talk trash… Mizuki… You gotta be kidding… This is an extreme body that\NI received from Lord Orochimaru… I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound\Nand become even more… Iruka Sensei What’s this?! It’s just as I thought, after all. Old Lady Tsunade… Lady Tsunade. His cells have started dying. You jerk…\NWhat have you done to me?! It’s not Naruto’s fault. It’s caused from the substances\Nyou took! What? That’s impossible! You’re getting a taste of\Nyour own medicine. That substance wasn’t\Nfully developed yet. The last casualty has been recovered. It appears that Shizune was injured,\Nbut there’s no threat to her life. I see. Thanks for your work. That’s a relief… Shizune is safe. Orochimaru probably developed\Nthat substance by chance while he was trying to develop\Na Forbidden Jutsu. What is certain is that that substance assimilates\Nthe DNA of animals and when it combines\Nwith the human body that serves to draw out its power\Nin an explosive manner. But its effect is only short term. And in exchange,\Nit puts a strain on the cells that far exceeds the limits\Nof the human body. It certainly isn’t something\Nthat’s one could actually use. But why did Mizuki…? I don’t know the details but it must be that Mizuki\Nand Orochimaru had a point of contact in the past… However… That tie has already been severed. Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru\Njust used him as a plaything. Giving him an unusable drug…\Nhe’s probably laughing his butt off. But Mizuki is one lucky guy… An ordinary Shinobi would\Nhave lost his life. Although he won’t be able to live\Nhis life as a Shinobi any more. Unfortunate, isn’t it, Naruto? I kind of had that feeling anyway… I see. But I won’t give up! I will continue to do my best to search\Nfor clues to Sasuke’s whereabouts. Tsubaki… Damn it, Iruka! Don’t talk! Next time I’ll take you and that\Nlittle squirt down without fail. There’s no way you\Ncould do that. While you were pursuing\Nyour futile dream, Naruto’s been actively honing\Nhis skills. You can’t possibly catch up\Nwith him any longer. Mizuki can never go back\Nto being a Shinobi again… Tsubaki… I’m thinking of starting over\Nagain too… But first I must atone for\Nall the trouble I caused the village… What a beautiful sunset. Let’s return to the village. Dried and Canned Goods Fish Market I won't… ever give up either! I did it! All right, since everybody\Nworked so hard today, I’m going to do something special\Nand treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku. Yippee! You’re a real man,\Nlruka Sensei! I want a block of barbecued pork! I want large portions of\Nall three kinds of ramen noodles – miso, soy sauce and butter! Hey, Iruka, before you do that, you and Naruto need to go\Nto Leaf Village Hospital. Huh…I told you I’m okay. Don’t argue with me. Lady Tsunade! I cleared the first stage! She’s just started her\Nascetic training… Could she be an exceptional talent\Non par with Shizune…? Hey, Sakura…! This time you saved me… You’ve really become stronger,\Nhaven’t you, Naruto. Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah I can't stand it any longer! No matter how long I wait, there's no clue\N about Sasuke's whereabouts! And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps\Ntelling me not to do a thing! At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke! Isn't there anything?

Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka At this point in time, I don’t even plan to fight\Nover Sasuke with you. Sakura! Do you know who\Nyou’re lipping off to?! Don’t press your luck,\Ncrybaby Sakura! It seems like...\Nit seems like Sakura was out of line! Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.\NShe’s scary. Hmm. That's not it… Huh? Sakura’s not the kind of kid\Nto do things like needlessly flaunt her\Nown power and hurt people. She doesn’t like having Ino\Ntaking pity on her and pulling punches. – This time for sure,\N– This time for sure, – with full strength,\N– with full strength, – a fair... fight!\N– a fair... fight! The Ultimate Battle: Cha! Just a Clone Jutsu…?! This isn’t a Ninja Academy’s\Ngraduation exam! You think you can beat me… with a textbook ninja art?! If I look carefully, I can find out,\Nwhich is the real one right away… Chakra to my feet at a burst…Then… repel off the ground! Fast! If you think I’m the crybaby Sakura\NI was until recently, you’ll get your fingers burned! Come like you mean it, Ino! I appreciate you saying that… I’ll go like I mean it, as you wish! Way to go Sakura! Great! Really great! With the fundamental movements\Nusing Chakra, she’s topnotch among the rookies… Huh? Sakura is at her best. That means…\Nls she better than me? Well! That’s right. Awww! Sending Chakra all throughout\Nthe body and using the technique\Nwith it at a right timing… Those techniques alone\Nare better than Sasuke. Well, from the start,\Nshe was extremely good at… controlling her Chakra, so… Magnificent movements, Sakura! However, her opponent is good too. This evenly-matched battle\Nlooks to take awhile! Since when did this girl\Nget this strong?! I can make it, too…! You little…! Whoa! At this rate, it’ll never end. This is long… They’ve been going at it\Nfor ten minutes, at the least. You shouldn’t be evenly\Nmatched with me! What makes you think\NI’m evenly matched with you… who’s only concerned with looks\Nand growing your hair frivolously?! You! You carry your mocking\Nof me too far! Idiot. She’s going for the bait. Who knows what Ino will do! I don’t like Ino when she’s that way…! You’re simple-minded… Uh-oh. She’s totally lost it! I don’t need this! S-Scary… I’ll put an end to this right now! I’ll make you say that you lost! Hey, don’t tell me… Could it be…? As I recall, that Sign is… I knew it… She’s planning to do\Nthe Mind Transfer Jutsu! Man…That idiot! I understand your feelings of frustration,\Nbut that’s futile. Humph! I wonder! Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu… A Jutsu where the user can take\Nover the opponent’s spirit and wrest their body away\Nfor a few minutes… by discharging all of\Ntheir own spiritual energy and striking the enemy with it. But, there are major flaws\Nto this formidable Jutsu. First, the discharged spiritual energy\Ncan only fly straight and at a slow speed. Second, even in the case of failing\Nto hit the enemy and missing, the user can’t return to her\Nown body for several minutes. I should add that during\Nthat interval, the user’s, in other words, your main body\Nwill turn into a doll that won’t move at all! In the first place, the Mind Transfer Jutsu is used\Nfor spying and is not a Jutsu for battle. Ino, using that Jutsu here\Nwould be equal to suicide… It shouldn’t be particularly\Nscary if she moves about… And not only that,\Nif she dodges the Jutsu, she can beat the heck out\Nof the non-moving opponent. If that happens, Hayate will be forced\Nto put an end to the match… So what?! I won’t know unless I try! If you miss, it’s over. You know that, right? In the first place,\Nit’s a combination Jutsu to be used after stopping the opponent’s\Nmovements during a battle with my Shadow Possession Jutsu. There’s no way! There is no way, it will hit… Idiot! Stop! Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu! Which one…? That was unfortunate… Ino. Has the fat lady sung…? She went and did it… Then, it’s over, eh. This is…?! You fell for it, Sakura! I finally caught you! It can't be! Yes, it can. My Sign weaving earlier was just an act, to drive you who was running\Nabout into this contrivance. So? You can’t move at all, can you? It’s special rope that’s my hair\Nwith Chakra poured in! With this, it will be over when\NI enter your body and say “give up!” It wouldn’t miss\Na hundred percent of the time! I see… That idiot… Her losing it\Nwas also an act? Get out of there, Sakura! I can’t move…! Then… Mind Transfer Jutsu! That was unfortunate… She missed! No! Sakura… Sakura! Sakura! W-What’s with Ino? Also... Sakura’s acting kind of strange!\NBelieve it! But…surely this is her chance! Do it, Sakura! It’s no use. To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there… Sakura’s had it. Mind Transfer…?! That means Sakura right now is… Yes. Sakura’s spirit has been\Ncompletely taken over by Ino. What?! Ino is inside of Sakura’s body now! Well. Ino’s purpose is most likely… With this, it’s over. Good bye, Sakura… I…Sakura Haruno concede… – this match… 					– No! Sakura! Tsk! He’s annoying! You did your hardest to get here! You’ll disgrace women if you lose\Nto that Sasuke-obsessed girl! Like I said, those words\Nare useless… What's... this bad chill…?! Naruto is annoying! Anyway, that’s right…\Nnot to Ino I won’t … Sakura?! This can’t be happening… What’s the matter? Are you conceding? I won’t be conceding! No Way! Cha! Which is it? W-What’s going on?! Sakura…?! No way! I messed up my Jutsu…? Ino…You’ll have a terrible time of it\Nif you don’t get out of me quick! What’s wrong, with Ino? No… I won’t hold on at this rate… Release! It can’t be…\NShe shattered Ino’s Jutsu! She used too much energy\Nbefore the Jutsu… So she didn’t have enough Chakra…?! To think she has two spirits…\NWhat are you?! Strength that ranks with beauty. Girls can’t survive if they’re not tough! If caught in that spell, it’s not that easy to cast out\Nthe invader… Ino’s lack of Chakra… There’s also that… But what was more effective\N than that… was the combative spirit towards\Nlno she has inside her heart. So that was awakened with Naruto’s voice\Nas the trigger and she cast Ino out…? There’s nothing to it. Like Naruto… Sakura’s fighting spirit was\Nmuch stronger than others. – This is…! 					– This is…! But, both of them should\Nhave hardly any Chakra left. – This is… 					– This is… – the end! 					– the end! Both parties are unable\Nto continue the match! By double knockout, no one gets through the\Nfourth battle of the preliminary! – What?! 					– Huh?! Now then... Good grief. Hey, Ino! Sakura! Sakura! A-A-Are you okay?! Treatment’s not necessary. They’ll probably wake up after awhile. But, that was surprising… Yeah… Naruto and Sasuke aside… to think even that Sakura who didn’t\Nhave what it took has grown this much… A lot happened, but I really feel like it\Nwas a good thing… sending her to this Chunin Exam. Tenten vs. Temari Seeing that made me all fired up, too! Now… The second one from the\NLand of Sand, huh… – This looks to be an interesting match.\N– Do your best, Tenten! It looks like you finally\Nwoke up, eh…Sakura. Huh?! Tenten, power of youth! Go Go! There is no limit to your youth! Our match is already over. Did I…lose? I’m the one who wants to cry… To think I tied with somebody like you… Huh? Here! You also got a flower to bloom, didn’t you? A beautiful flower! Ino… However... the next time we fight, it won’t end with you\Ngetting knocked out! Hm…?! And… I won’t hand over\NSasuke to you! I return the same line to you! – Humph! 					– Humph! The fifth battle… Tenten, Temari…\Ncome forward! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

There is no way that I alone can\Nlose in a place like this! Guy Sensei…please allow it. It is now… A time to carry through and protect\None’s own Way of the Ninja!

What?! And also, the fourth gate,\Nthe Gate of Pain…open! What an incredible guy… It’s not as though effort alone\Ncan make this happen… That boy… is he in fact a genius…? He’s fast! Gaara! Where are they?! He’s above! But we can’t find Lee! Where?! The sand isn’t keeping up at all! So it’s the Sand Armor again…? Then how’s this?! What…?! This Sand Armor is… being peeled away…! You’re a stubborn one. Since it comes to this… The muscles have torn… Is that really Lee…? When did he become like this…? This is the end! The Fifth Gate of Closing…open! I can’t defend myself… Is this the movement of\Na human being?! Neji… This technique is my ace in\Nthe hole to take you down… but I will specially show it to you! Huh?! The Sand Shield can’t keep up! Most of the armor has also\N been peeled off… He’s done for! W-Wow! Hidden Lotus… In other words... it’s a high-speed continuous\NTaijutsu that can’t even be touched! The answer to take Neji down is\Nthat high speed combination… There is no way that\Nthe sand can keep up! This technique will be the last! Hidden Lotus! I can’t see anything, it’s too fast… That’s impossible… The gourd has turned to sand…? He’s done it this time! Gaara! Lee… Oh! What’s…that? He protects himself… using a gourd made of sand?! That technique is…! Sand Coffin! No way! He got hit by the Hidden Lotus and is still able to bring\Nforth a technique…! Sand Coffin! I just can not lose in a place like this… I want to… my Way of the Ninja… Oh no! Die! Why…? Why…save him? He’s… I’m all right! I’m strong so… The Chunin Exam… Guy Sensei, please watch\Nme with a smile... I’d like to prove that I could\Nbecome a respectable Ninja even though I can’t use Ninjutsu! That would be the ultimate for me! He is... an important subordinate\Nwhom I care for! A subordinate…whom I care for...? Those words are definitely\Nnot understandable to Gaara… I quit… He quit…? The moment Guy jumped in,\NLee lost. The winner… Gaa-! – Wha…? 					– Huh? – Huh? 					– Huh? Wha--?! That’s impossible… Having opened the fifth gate… And his hand and feet are crushed… There’s no way he should\Nbe able to stand…! Lee… It’s all right. It’s over! You’re in no condition to stand…! Lee… Y-You… You are… Even after having\Nlost consciousness… You still want to prove your\Nown Way of the Ninja…? So he had already… lost consciousness… Lee... You’re already… a respectable Ninja…! The winner… Gaara. Lee! Stop! Even if you went down\Nwhat could you do? Your words of encouragement\Nwould only make him feel worse. There’s no way he could\Nhave beaten Gaara… He was faced with a tougher battle\Nthan we thought… That Naruto… Bushy Brow lost\Nto a guy like this…! Medics, please hurry. Bushy Brow… Lee… You are the Jonin in charge of him,\Naren’t you? Y-Yes. Please come with me\Nfor a minute. Careful… Don’t shake him. There is faint breathing… but because of comminuted fractures\Nand muscle tears to his entire body, recovery will likely to take\Nquite some time… If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad, but… The damage to the left arm\Nand leg which received the attack is severe… It’s too severe… Oh…! I don’t want to say this, but he won't be able to...\Nlive as a Shinobi again. T-That… that can’t be true… I will take Bushy Brow down.\NBelieve it! It is not you whom I want to fight,\Nit’s Uchiha! You…! Naruto, I get where you're\Ncoming from, believe me. But all fighting must be done\Nofficially in a match! The failure beats the gifted genius\Nthrough sheer effort… Wouldn't that make for\Nan exciting main battle? Though, I am probably going\N to be the one fighting Neji… Lee… I didn’t want to think... that you’d lose. I wanted to let you fulfill… your Way of the Ninja! Yay! I finally mastered it! Yahoo! This technique… after all, only Lee managed to master… Okay, you became Genin\N from today. I want to hear what it is\Nyou all are aiming for! I-I’d like to prove that I can become\Na respectable Ninja even though I can’t use\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu! That would be the ultimate for me! Please forgive me for not… stopping it...! Lee… It’s not true…it’s not true. After hearing that,\Nwhat should Bushy Brow do…?! This guy… He said the failure would take\Ndown a genius with effort…! Isn’t there something that\Ncan be done?! Calm down, Naruto. B-But…Kakashi Sensei! He kept saying he wanted\Nto battle Sasuke and Neji! Perhaps…that led to his ruin. To fulfill that dream… the boy even used a self-sacrificing\Nforbidden technique to try to win! The result is what you see… That boy… Sasuke and Neji… and you… he sacrificed himself to\Na promise he never spoke of. He risked his life… so that he might have\Na chance to battle you guys… Don't forget that… I wonder if Lee… will be all right…? Lee… You didn’t realize it even at the end… Heaven does not allow it. One who tries to move ahead\Nwhile achieving victory through a method like dying\Nupon each other’s swords. So it ended without incident… Welcome back Gaara. Guy… Well… I spoke self-importantly earlier but… I’ve thought about it and\Nhad I been in your position… I probably... wouldn’t have\Nbeen able to stop him. Guy. We’re in the way of the\Nnext tournament…let’s go up. All right… Then, the tenth and final round is next,\Nboth contestants come forward! So it’s finally my turn… I’m gonna win and have\Nsome barbecued beef! In any case, I need to last until\Nthe main tournament and battle Sasuke. Or I will not have met your expectations,\NLord Orochimaru… I can almost see through it… The reason that you went to the trouble\Nof getting to Sasuke before us and... putting a Curse Mark on him\Nwithout killing him… In other words, we were the guinea pigs to measure\NSasuke’s abilities during the examinations. What you wanted isn’t Sasuke’s life,\Nbut Sasuke himself… I was also taken for a fool… Now, let the tenth round begin. Hey, can you hear it?

1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox\Nappeared with nine tails. With its powerful tails, it could smash mountains\Nand create tidal waves. A band of Ninjas rose to\Ndefend their village from attack. We have to wait until\Nthe Fourth Hokage gets here! We can't let it get any closer\Nto our village! One great Ninja was able to\Nimprison the monster, but died in the process. This Ninja was known as…\Nthe Fourth Hokage. Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! You're really gonna get it this time! I don't care! You know your problem? You can't do the things I do! Only I can do this! I'm better than all of you!\NBelieve it! There's a problem, sir! Lord Hokage! What is it? Did that Naruto do something again? Yes. He climbed onto\Nthe Mountainside Images… And he vandalized and\Ngraffitied all over them! Wait! Ha ha… Why should I? Hey, Naruto! How did you suddenly get here,\Nlruka Sensei? The question is what are you doing here\Nwhen you should be in class now? Now listen, Naruto. You failed the last graduation test\Nand the one before that. This is no time\Nto be goofing off, you fool! We will have a re-test on\Nthe Transformation Jutsu! Even those who already passed\Nwill take it! Whaaaat?! Sakura Haruno. Here I go… Transform! OK! I did it! Cha! Did you see that, Sasuke? Next, Sasuke Uchiha. Yes. O-OK. Next, Naruto Uzumaki. This is a real pain. And it's all your fault. Like I care!! OK… Good luck, Naruto… Transform! How was it? I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""! You fool!\NStop making idiotic spells! Darn… Darn… I won't let you go home\Nunless you clean that all up. I don't care… There's nobody home anyway. Naruto... What is it this time? What I meant was… If you clean up all that mess,\NI'll buy you ramen tonight. Huh?! Yes!\NI-I will finish it no time! Enter: Naruto Uzumaki! Naruto. Why did you vandalize those faces? Don't you know who\Nthe Hokage leaders are? Of course, I do! I know they earned the title\NLord Hokage because they were the best Ninja\Nof their time, right? Especially the Fourth Hokage\Nwas a hero who saved the village from\Nthe nine-tail demon fox. Then why did you do that? Because I'll become a Hokage myself. And I'll be the greatest Hokage\Nof all time! So that everyone will finally\Nlearn to accept me! By the way, Sensei,\NI have a favor to ask. You want another bowl? Mmmm…No… Can I borrow that Leaf headband\Nfor a while? This? No no! This is worn only by those who\Nhave graduated from Ninja Academy. Tomorrow, you will… You're so mean! So that's why you took off\Nyour goggles… Humph...\NOne more bowl please! We are now about to begin\Nthe graduation test. When your name is called,\Nproceed to the next classroom. The test is on the Clone Jutsu. Oh no… Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu! But still…\NI will do it no matter what! Clone Jutsu! Disqualified! Iruka Sensei. His physical coordination\Nand stamina are excellent. And he managed to come up\Nwith something. Isn't that enough\Nfor him to pass? Mizuki Sensei...\NAll the others created three or more clones. Naruto created just one. And it's practically useless.\NI can't give him a passing mark. I 'm a Ninja now! You did well. That's my son. Congratulations for your graduation. I'll cook something good tonight! Look at that one. It's that boy.\NI hear he's the only one who failed. Serves him right. Imagine what would happen\Nif he became a Ninja. Isn't that the boy\Nwho is actually… Hey! We're not supposed to\Ntalk about that. Iruka.\NWe need to talk later. Yes, sir. Iruka Sensei isn't trying\Nto be mean to you. Then why only me? He wants you to become strong\Nfrom the bottom of his heart. You both don't have parents. But I really wanted to graduate. Heh... I guess I have no choice… I'll let you in on a big secret. Secret? Iruka. What is it, Lord Hokage? I know how you feel. But… Naruto also grew up without knowing\Nthe love of his parents…like you. Let me go! My mom and dad are\Nstill out there fighting! Wake up, Iruka Sensei! What's the matter? Come to Lord Hokage's immediately! I heard that Naruto…\Nstole the Scroll of Sealing. The Scroll of Sealing?! Let's see… The first Jutsu is…\NMulti-Shadow Clone Jutsu? What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at? Lord Hokage!\NWe can't forgive him! This is not just a prank! The Scroll is a dangerous item\Nthat the First Hokage sealed! Depending on its use… It will be a major disaster if\Nit is taken out of the village! Yes. Bring Naruto here at once! Yes, sir! Where did you go…Naruto? I will tell everyone in the village\Nabout this and eliminate Naruto… Then the Scroll of Sealing\Nwill be mine! Hey you, Naruto! You found me.. And I've only learned one Jutsu. He's been practicing the Jutsu… until he's become\Nthis exhausted and dirty…? Listen, listen!\NI'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu! You're gonna let me graduate\Nif I can do it! Isn't it true that I can graduate if\NI can do one of the Jutsu written here? Who told you that? Mizuki Sensei. He told me\Nabout this scroll, and this place… Mizuki did?! I'm impressed you found this place. I see now…how it is. Naruto, give me that scroll. Wait, wait…\NWhat's going on here? Naruto! Never give him that scroll! It is a dangerous object that contains\Nforbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed. Mizuki used you in order to\Nget it for himself! W-Wha--? Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of\Nyou holding that scroll! Huh? What are you saying, Mizuki!\NDon't let him fool you, Naruto! I will tell you the truth. Idiot! Don't do that! After an incident 12 years ago,\Na rule was created. A rule? That is, Naruto, a rule everybody\Nbut you knows. Except me?! 					What is it? Stop it, Mizuki! The rule forbids anyone from revealing\Nthat you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit! Huh? You are actually the Demon,\NNine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who killed Iruka's parents and\Ndestroyed our village! Stop it! Everyone has been\Ndeceiving you ever since. Didn't you find it strange? Why everyone hated you so much? No! No! No! No! No! Naruto… Nobody accepts you.\NThat's why Iruka hates you so much! Iruka... Naruto grew up\Nwithout the love of parents. Everyone avoids him like\Nthe plague after what happened. That's why he keeps misbehaving. It's the only way for him to get\Nany attention or acknowledgement. He pretends to be tough,\Nbut inside he is really hurting. Die, Naruto! Naruto! 					Get down! Why…? Because you and I are the same. After my parents died, nobody paid attention to me\Nor gave me any support. I wasn't a good student in school. I was the class clown…\Nbecause I wanted people to notice me. I couldn't get noticed through excellence,\Nso I kept doing stupid things. It was so hard. Isn't that right, Naruto? You felt so lonely…right?\NAnd you suffered inside, right? I'm sorry, Naruto…. If I had been more responsible,\Nmaybe you wouldn't have suffered so much. Don't make me laugh! Iruka has always hated you,\Never since you killed his parents! He's just saying all that\Nto get the Scroll of Sealing back! Naruto! Narutoooooo! He is not the type of kid\Nwho will change his mind. He will take revenge against\Nour village using that scroll! Didn't you see his eyes?\NThose are the eyes of a Demon Fox. No…\NNaruto…isn't…like that at all! All I want is to kill Naruto\Nand get the scroll. I'll take care of you later! I-I won't let you… Well, well. Mizuki has a big mouth! Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt. He might unleash\Nthe power locked up inside him. The Scroll of Sealing is now with him. There's a slight chance\Nhe might actually release the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit\Nsealed inside him! If that happens… I've found him! Naruto! Everything that Mizuki said\Nwas a lie! Give me that scroll, quick!\NMizuki is after the scroll! It can't be… Why is it, Naruto? How… did you know I wasn't Iruka…? Because I'm Iruka. I see. What's in it for you to protect\Nthe one who killed your family? I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot\Nlike you get that scroll! You're the idiot.\NNaruto is the same as me. Same? Anyone can do whatever\Nhe wants once he has the scroll. There is no way that that monster… that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage\Nof the power of that scroll! You're right… I guess it was true all along! See, Iruka Sensei never really\Ncared for me at all! ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit. But Naruto is different! I know that he is an exceptional student. He works very hard, and he's single-minded\Nand clumsy at the same time. No one accepts him, but he knows\Nthe meaning of human suffering. He is not the Demon Fox Spirit. He's Naruto Uzumaki of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves! You are so gullible. 					lruka! I was gonna take you down later,\Nbut I have changed my mind. Die! I guess this is the end for me… Naruto?! You surprised me there, freak. If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,\NI'll kill you! Shut up! I can take care of a kid\Nlike you with a single blow! Why don't you try then?\NI'll strike you back a thousand-fold! Let's see you try!\NShow me what you can do, Demon Fox! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! You've… Those aren't just images but actual clones!\NThat's an advanced Ninjutsu! What's this…? What's the matter? 					C'mon! Weren't you gonna get me\Nwith one blow? Here! In that case…\NI'll come to you. I kinda got carried away.\Nlruka Sensei, are you okay? Yeah. He's really something. Maybe it is true. Maybe he will surpass all\Nthe Hokage leaders… Naruto, come over here.\NI'd like to give you something. Has anyone found Naruto yet? No. Darn, this is going to be bad… There's no need to worry anymore. Lord Hokage! He'll be back soon. Sensei, how much longer? OK, you may open your eyes now. Congratulations…on your graduation. In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight! Iruka Sensei! That hurts! Naruto… I was going to lecture to you... that the road gets more difficult\Nnow that you're a Ninja. But I guess I'll just wait to tell you\Nthat until we get to the ramen stand… W-What do you want, you little shrimp?\NQuit following me! You're smaller than me and you're saying that you're gonna\Nbecome the Fifth Hokage? I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's\Ngrandson or not. It's not that easy to be a Hokage!

108,"Connecting old words\Nthat have been used up I just want to convey\Nmy simple thoughts That day's faint wind blows away at the castle ruins of yesterday I'll laugh with you\Nand live for the moment Still that incident\Nwill continue to trouble you, right? That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu! Wh-What is that Jutsu?! Damn it! Chidori: One Thousand Birds! I’ll win no matter what! Don’t flatter yourself! Stop it! Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds It’s a tranquil village as always… The security sucks. Humph! We should just massacre everybody\Nin such a seedy village. Calm down, Sakon. We haven’t come here to fight. Shut up, you chicken. If you’re scared, you should just go home\Nand go to bed already. I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya. You understand what\Nour job is this time, right? Let’s go.\NWe escort our special guest. Stop it! Damn. I can’t stop completely. Kakashi Sensei? Naruto… That thing you just did was… What’re you guys doing\Nup on top of the hospital? You went a bit too far\Nfor just a fight, you two. That Jutsu earlier, no mistake. It’s the Rasengan. What’s going on? How can Naruto use that Jutsu…? Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke? What’re you doing giving yourself over\Nto a sense of superiority? The size of the Chidori there\Nwasn’t one to be aimed at a comrade of the same village. Why such infantile behavior…? Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi… Sasuke. Damn it! Naruto… How far will you go…? Kakashi Sensei… Whatever happened to teamwork? Was it you…\Nwho taught him that technique? I think Naruto is still too young\Nto be handling that Jutsu. He could’ve killed Sasuke\Nhad something gone wrong… Even if it’s a means of resisting\Nthe Akatsuki, to think you would teach Naruto\Nthat Jutsu… Right back at you… That Chidori was also considerably hairy. But I didn’t think he was\Nthe kind of kid who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade. Or is it that there’s something quite\Ncomplicated between him and that kid? Well, all sorts. All sorts? Quite simply, it’s a relationship like the one between you\Nand Orochimaru in the past. I see. To him, Sasuke is a comrade\Nand a rival at the same time… Well, someone he considers\Nan equal. Most likely, he couldn’t take\NSasuke’s cheap provocation. He’s been chasing him… Chasing him since the Academy days. Are you hurt… Scaredy-Cat? Sasuke! I won’t lose to you! For him, it’s neither you\Nnor me now… More than anyone… he wants to be recognized by Sasuke. On the other side of the coin… Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growth\Nat close range and feels inferior. To the extent that he thinks\Nhe himself isn’t growing at all. Scaredy-Cat? Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Summoning Jutsu! Naruto has gotten strong… And Sasuke… I’m going to kill a certain man,\Nno matter what. Revenge, huh…? I wonder if Itachi\Nis frustrating that kid. So Sasuke doesn’t want\Nto acknowledge Naruto. If he acknowledges him, he just might deny himself\Nup to this point… Rivalry is a difficult thing. It’s not a very good trend… Maybe I’ll do some scolding. Then I leave Naruto to you. Well, I have a mission.\NAnd there’s the Chidori thing, too… Sakura. It’s okay. Things can go back to the way\Nthey were in the old days again. Cheer up. See ya. Thanks, Kakashi Sensei. Naruto… Sakura. Don’t interfere with us! You are weak. Why are you weak? It's because you don’t have enough… …hate. What’ve I been doing… up until now? He got a nice look in those eyes. Shall we go soon? What do you think you’re doing? If I don’t do this,\Nyou’ll run away, right? You’re not the type\Nto listen quietly to lectures. As I recall,\Nthat’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja. Sasuke… Forget about something\Nlike revenge. What? Well, in this business\NI’ve seen a stink of guys like you. But the final days of those who speak\Nof revenge are never good. They’re tragic. You’ll only hurt yourself and\Nagonize more than now. Even if you succeed in revenge,\Nall that will remain is emptiness. Shut up! What do you know? Don’t talk to me as if you know! Well, calm down… If you like, shall I go and kill the person\Nmost important to you? You’ll be able to realize just\Nhow far off you are on what you just said. Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that. Unfortunately, I don’t even have\None person like that. Everyone’s already been killed. I’ve lived longer than you have… The times were not good. I know all too well\Nthe agony of losing something. Well, both you and I\Naren’t the lucky ones… That’s for darned sure. But we’re not the worst, either. You and I, we both have already found\Ndear comrades, haven’t we? It’s because I have lost\Nthat I understand. The Chidori is a power… I gave to you because\Nyou now have something important. You should know that\Nit’s not a power to be used on your comrade\Nor to use for revenge, and I’m sure you know\Nwhat it should be used for. Think hard about whether or not\Nwhat I’m saying is wrong. It’ll be tricky with a Shinobi\Nof that level hanging around. So let’s wait a bit. Maybe jerks like you’d be no good.\NBut I could do it. I wonder. “Two”\Nshould be ample to rip him apart. Don’t be butting in all the time,\Nyou clod. Tayuya, women shouldn’t\Nuse words like that too… Shut up, fatso. – More, please!\N– More, please! Wanna head back? Sure! We both made it\Nto the top of the tree. Sakura. I have a something to talk\Nto you about. I’ll go out on a date with you,\Nso come along. Damn it… Damn it! The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru\Nduring the Chunin Exam… Kakashi Sensei said\Nit was okay now, but… Master Orochimaru. You didn’t need to send out\Nall four members, did you? It seems those kids are all interested\Nin Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking. To see what extent his power is… A contest of strength or whatever, at this point Sasuke would be\Nno match for them.

I’ll show you there are walls which effort alone can\Nnever break through. Sakura Blossoms! Huh?! Your Jutsu is indeed fast. But our Jutsu exceeds that\Nand is the speed of sound! Lee! My left ear... There’s a little gimmick I have. Evading won’t work...\Non my attacks. What is he going to do?! It’s sound. Even though you evaded my fist,\Nsound assaulted you. Sound? Do you know what sound is\Nall about in the first place? Vibration? Correct. In other words,\Nhearing sounds means, that the eardrum is\Ncatching vibrating air. And the human eardrum breaks\Nwith sounds over 150 Mhz. Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal\Nwhich is located even deeper, I can make you totally lose balance. You won’t be able to move your body\Nfreely for sometime. Something old and tired\Nlike Taijutsu don’t work on us. Well, you were doing good\Nup to a certain point, but I brought forth my Jutsu. It’s just not gonna work anymore. I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves\Nand air pressure, and have the power to\Nobliterate even boulders! Primary Lotus! I can send air into the ground and change the dirt into\Na cushion as I please. It’s different from\Nyour silly Jutsu. Blast it! Lee, it is all right to use\Nthis Jutsu to protect someone precious. Protect... someone precious? In any case, I’m impressed that you\Nwere able to master it, little man! You did it quite well, Lee! Darn it! Okay, then! Next is... You! Darn it! He’s coming! What?! No way! Lee! Leaf... Hurricane! It looks like my earlier attack\Nis having an effect! I’m somewhat surprised... but there’s not even a trace of\Nthat flash of combo Taijutsu you showed! This arm amplifies sounds\Nfrom within to its maximum. It’s a speaker of sorts! Lee! And the assault sound isn’t limited\Nby the direction of my arm... it always converges on\Nthe targeted prey by my Chakra! Lee! Now then... 					The final blow. I won’t let you! Oh, well. Hey, let’s get outta here! Those guys are pretty dangerous! It looks like Sasuke and Naruto\Nare only unconscious, but... even that guy Lee’s been\Nmessed up and Sakura’s alone. What’re you gonna do, Ino? What do you mean? Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble! You’re all right with that? Huh?! You two were once close friends,\Nweren’t you? By the way... What Sakura, don’t be so stiff! Well... Ino, I hear you also... What is it? ...like Sasuke. Then, that means from now on, you and I are rivals. Why... why am I recalling things\Nfrom that time? Hey, Ino! What’re you gonna do?! I know, but there’s nothing I can do! I can’t heedlessly\Ngo out there, can I?! Even if I went out now... I’d be taken down without a doubt. I also... I also...! Air pressure!\NThe shurikens got bounced back?! Your hair’s shinier than mine. Hey! If you have time to worry\Nabout your hair, you should practice! Getting all spiced up like a woman... Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guy\Nright in front of this sexy bug, Zaku? Yeah! That sounds great! Hey hey... I won’t let you do such a thing! Don’t move! Sakura. My body... It has no strength. I... Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet! I’m always being protected. It's so frustrating! This time for sure...\NI had thought! This time for sure... I must protect people precious to me...\Nso I thought! So... Let’s do this! Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are\Ngonna get it, too! W-What should I do?! That’s pointless! That won’t work on me! What are you saying? Huh? What?! I always... act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja. I always say that I like Sasuke. I always act like I know everything\Nand lecture Naruto. I always just... watch them from behind. And yet... Tazuna, get back! Get back! Now then... Let’s get wild! This is the only way to\Ntake him down! Sasuke! Here it is! Those two always covered\Nmy back and fought for me. Lee, you say that you like me... I’ll protect you until I die! Primary Lotus! With me at your back... you risked your life and\Nfought for me. I have a feeling that you taught me... Sakura! Sakura! Humph! I want to be like all of you! This time... I want all of you... to watch me... ...from behind! Sakura? Sakura... Kin! Kill her! Huh! That sign... Substitution Jutsu! On the right, huh?\NYou think I’m a fool? With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu... you think you can come at me?! Kin, get out of the way! Useless! Air pressure 100 percent,\Nultrasonic waves 0%, output... Is that all you can do? Slicing Sound Wave! You’re easy to spot... You’re above! I’ve said it two or three times that\Nthat won’t work! This is enough... for you! Where next? Huh?! What...?! This time... it’s not a substitution! Get off me! Hey! Sakura... You’re always being called\N“Billboard Brow” and being picked on. Who’re you? I’m called Ino Yamanaka.\NHow ‘bout you? I’m... Sakura. Huh? I can’t hear you.\NSay it louder. Sakura Haruno! Huh, I see. You have a wide forehead. So, Billboard Brow, huh...? That’s why you hide\Nyour forehead with your bangs. Like a ghost... Sakura, was it? Uh-huh... Come back here tomorrow. I’ll give you something nice. Huh? Darn, let go! See! You look cuter like this, Sakura! I’ll give you that ribbon. T-Thanks. But... But what? My forehead... You hide it, so people make\Nmore fun of you, you know?! You have a cute face Sakura,\Nso you should be more confident! More confident! Ino... Hey, who’s that?\NWho’s she, Ino? Her name’s Sakura. Hey, say hello! Hello... Listen everybody! Listen! There’s someone I like!\NWho do you think it is? Hurry up and tell us! Don’t say it’s Sasuke? Huh? Why’d you know? What’re you talking about? Sasuke’s really popular,\Nhe’s the most popular! Huh? Is that so? Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals.\NWhat should I do?! Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately! She’s just acting brave\Nand romping around! Ino! I’ve heard Sasuke\Nlikes girls with long hair. ...likes girls with long hair.\N...likes girls with long hair. Sakura... I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino. From now on, we’re rivals. Your hair.

I will... Give it up! It’s really bad... Hey, Ino...! I must... protect everyone! You punk! Huh? Huh! More strange ones. Ino...? Sakura! I promised\NI wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

Get real!\NWe can’t afford such leisure ! That’s right! Besides, if we’re going\Nto attack anyway, isn’t it more advantageous\Nto use the darkness and attack?! For us, the darkness works\Nto our advantage only the moment\Nwe launch the attack. It’d be close to impossible\Nto grab Sasuke, get away from them and escape\Nto a safe location in just that one moment. If we couldn’t get Sasuke\Nback in that one moment, they’d probably just focus\Non guarding the coffin. If that happens, we wouldn’t stand\Na chance in the darkness. On the contrary, for the part where they wouldn’t\Nhave to move needlessly, suddenly they’d get the advantage. It’d be a different story\Nif we had Neji’s Byakugan, but… Hey, come on.

I can’t say that we have\Nlots of time to spare, but I guess we’ll make it in time. I hope so. Lord Orochimaru… Sasuke… No Sasuke…yet? He’s running out of time…\NHe can’t go on any longer. Lord Orochimaru… Several bodies have been\Nprepared for you! And…you could even use me,\Nif necessary… It has to be Sasuke… How long do you think I’ve waited? It’s a matter of urgency! The Third Hokage’s Jutsu… His curse was stronger\Nthan expected! Take this! Sealing Jutsu!\NReaper Death Seal! Wh-What’s this sensation? Seal! My arm… If you don’t “reanimate” right now,\Nyou’ll lose everything! Is that what you want?! Lose everything… I’ve selected and prepared\Nproficient bodies for you. Please leave it to me! Also… I’ll handle the recovery\Nof Sasuke as well. Shall I use Kimimaro? Curse you … Third Hokage! Release! Listen well, everyone! I shall release you from this prison… However, it’ll only\Nbe one of you! Now all that’s left is to\Nwake up Kimimaro, huh? Just as I thought… I wasn’t summoned this time, either. Dr. Kabuto, I… Take care of your body. Your role is now finished. It’s not Sound Ninja Five now,\NKimimaro… I…still haven’t… Your replacement has\Nalready been found. He possesses power equal\Nto your “Earth” Curse Mark. He has been given\Nthe “Heaven” Curse Mark. Additionally, he even\Nhas the Kekkei Genkai. Wonder who’s stronger… What’s the matter?\NDon’t get too excited. Dr. Kabuto… M-My life, how much do I have left? You shouldn’t talk anymore… P-People… People are born\Nwith some kind of meaning… Since people are born, there must be some kind\Nof important calling. Recently I’ve started thinking so… That the meaning for being born… For people, finding the meaning is… the only freedom God has given. I understand what you want to say. Indeed, Lord Orochimaru\Nis now suffering. It’s an unprecedented\Ndifficult situation, but I’ll mince no words. What can you do now? You’ve now lost your value\Nas a “vessel.” A new vessel is heading this way. Well… At this point in time,\Nit’s too late, but… Okay! You said you were going\Nto let one person out of here. You’re going to keep\Nyour promise. What’re you doing?\NOpen the door now! What? There was another one? Hurry up and… No…I…\NI’ll be eaten here, right now… I’ll let you out of here… And I shall grant you\Njust one wish. My clan that was captured\Nfor your experiments. Please release them. Sure. Consider it done. You don’t have to worry. Your strong will is going to remain\Nas Residual Aura inside me. It’s not like you’ll lose everything. Now then, your flesh is mine… With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body\Nwill, once again be unable to reanimate\Nfor several years. However, there is the next time. I-Indeed… my body no longer has value\Nas a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu. It will now be difficult for me\Nwho has lost everything… to find my own calling. I’ve finally understood that… Even if it’s not me, I’ll bring in the new “vessel”\Neven if it costs me my life.

That’s why we’re in this situation! What do you mean by ""fool""? I’m just speaking the truth, fool! Oh! You said ""fool"" again! Everybody, be quiet for a second! Choji? Now he’s squatting down.\NWhat is he thinking? Hey! Why are you eating snacks\Nall of a sudden?! Choji binge eats when he gets upset… Geez, another useless guy. It can’t be helped!\Nln this case, Shadow Clone…! Stop it. The enemy’s Chakra is placed\Nall over that wall. Even if you are able to scratch it,\Nthe wall will restore itself right away. In other words, it’s useless\Nunless we can attack it with a Taijutsu that has enough power\Nto destroy this wall with one blow. Somebody that has a Taijutsu\Nwith greater destructive power than mine would be Choji, but… At this rate… Darn, what do we do! Neji… I’m sorry, but can you use\Nthe rest of the Chakra you have to observe the wall behind you\Nand the wall behind Choji? I got it. Shikamaru! You be quiet! Naruto! You still don’t understand?! Remember what Shikamaru said\Nwhen he gathered everyone! Even I can't just sit back\Nand be a sluggard. Because I'm responsible\Nfor your lives. Choji, don’t raise your voice\Ntoo much from here. Kiba, dent that wall\Nbehind Neji and Choji again! Y-Yeah… Huh! I don’t fully understand\Nwhat’s going on, but I’ll go wild one more time! Tunneling Fang! Huh! No matter how hard you try,\Nit’s useless! Huh, I see… It’s over there. Neji! Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife. Choji, are you ready?! Okay! Any time! All right, let’s do this. What’s happening?! Like I said earlier,\Nthe wall’s surface is planted with Chakra. But even this tough wall could have\Nan area that have a thin layer of Chakra. That is what Shikamaru speculated. How…How did you get all of that? Think about what happened earlier. Because he noticed that\Nthere were areas that restored quickly and others that didn’t so quickly when Kiba and Akamaru attacked\Nthe wall surface. In other words, he guessed that\Nthose areas that didn’t restore quickly probably has a thin layer\Nof Chakra. On top of all that,\Nby cleverly talking to the enemy, he figured out the position\Nof the enemy outside of the wall. He guessed that\Nthe wall furthest from the enemy probably had the thinnest point\Nof Chakra, so that’s what he wanted to confirm. That’s what it is, correct? I see, in order to trick the enemy,\Nyou must trick your friends first. I didn’t see that there was\Nsuch a plan behind that conversation. Then, Choji realized the plan and the reason why he was eating\Nwas to replenish his Chakra. These two… They haven’t been working together\Nas a team all these years for nothing. I’m depending on you, Choji. Yeah! Expansion Jutsu! All right, let’s go! Human Boulder! What?! Choji… You are awesome, after all! Once in a long while, once in a while The remnants of a person\Nbroken by dreams Look like a mountain Clinging to the Divine,\Nclinging to Buddha The remnants of a person crying Look like a mountain Rendezvous with a happy dance circle This is my victory pose, round and around\N (round around) Shake shake shake\NLet’s look With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Look like a mountain Huh? What are you saying\Nall of a sudden, Choji! There’s no way that’s possible! But, Choji is right. If we keep lagging, we won’t be able\Nto catch up with Sasuke. But still… Don’t worry. I have an idea. Choji, are you possibly thinking… Do you have a plan or something? Yeah. Hey! Choji! That’s right!\NI have that secret weapon of mine! Next time:\N“Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!” I’m the one who will defeat that guy!",,,,0.1104004755616188,,,,0.08999486276089945
2,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Hey, you! Are you sure you want\Nto look like that? Yes, of course!\NC'mon! So hurry hurry! Don't regret it later. Say cheese! My Name Is Konohamaru! I couldn't decide on how to look. It took me 3 hours to decide. But as you can see,\Nit's more like a work of art. Doesn't it look great? Take it over. What?! Take it over. Stop saying that! Transform! Oh please, Lord Hokage… The Sexy Jutsu…\NThat's quite a devious technique. By the way Naruto,\Nwhere's your headband? I won't wear it until the orientation.\Nlt might get scratched Well, that's just fine. But the Ninja Registration Form\Nis a very important document held in high regard by our village. Why do you want to look like this? Because! Anyway, how should I know\Nabout all that stuff? Old man!\NGet ready to fight! I am going to be the Fifth Hokage! Ouch! If it's not one thing, it's another…. Drat! Is this a trap? Are you okay,\NHonorable Grandson? May I just inform you that\Nthere aren't any traps here… Huh? What's with this runt? What?! I know this kid…\NHe's that Nine-Tailed boy! He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel! You must have done this to me! You tripped all by yourself, stupid! Hey! Let go of him! He is the Honorable Grandson\Nof the Third Hokage! He stopped as soon as\Nhe learned who I am…. He's like my four-eyed teacher. He's just like everyone else! What's the matter? Weren't you gonna hit me, huh? Can't do it 'cuz\NI'm the Hokage's grandson, eh? As if I care! 					lmbecile! This guy… What?! Good grief… Listen to me. You are the Honorable Grandson\Nof the Third Hokage. Even though that scoundrel hit you,\Nyou must not associate with his kind. Nothing good will come of\Nyour tangling with him. This is your distinguished\Nteacher Ebisu, and I am never wrong\Nabout these things! Don't you want to become\Nthe Fifth Hokage? Then allow me\Nto teach you Ninjutsu, so that your dream will\Nbecome a reality. That's right. Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut\Ntowards becoming the Fifth Hokage. Is that clear, Honorable Grandson? He's gone! It seems he's gone after Naruto. Oh no! This is terrible! Honorable Grandson! How did he become like this? That was the 20th sneak attack today. And now he's in the company of Naruto.\NI'm a bit worried. I just hope he doesn't pick up\Nmore foolishness. Huh? Stop following me! What is it now?! Your camouflage is pathetic. You've seen through my disguise... Your reputation is well-earned. I will allow you to make me\Nyour apprentice. But you must first teach me that\N ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique you used to beat Grandpa Hokage. You gotta be kidding. I beg you to say yes, boss! Huh? Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss! I guess I have no choice. Listen. In order to become a skilled Ninja, you must first learn to\Ncontrol your Chatora. Chatora? Yes, Chatora. Boss, I think you mean Chakra. Silence! That's what real Ninjas call it! Oh! I didn't know that! Whew… I'm glad he's a fool. Listen. Chakra essentially means… Basically, it is the energy needed\Nin order to use Jutsu. Huh? In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts\Ncombine the Chakra, the physical energy accumulated\Nfrom each cell in the body with spiritual energy intensified\Nthrough training and experience. This combined energy is summoned\Nwith certain hand signs. You made me think\Nyou knew all that, when you were just reading\Nfrom a scroll! Much has been said about\Nperfecting the Ninja techniques, but it really boils down\Nto just one thing. And what is that? Hard work and guts. Hard work and guts? That's right. So be ready for the challenging tasks\NI will give you. Yes, boss! Good. Let's start right now.\NTransform for me. Huh? Let me see first\Nhow much you already know. But what do I transform into? OK... First, transform into that lady. An easy task, boss. Transform! Well, do I look like her? Uhm… Well, the clothes do and… And what's so similar\Nabout that?! Honorable Grandson. If you will transform into me,\Nat least try to look a little cuter, OK? She's scary! Why am I the one who gets hit? OK!\NNext, we'll do some research on sexiness! Yes, boss! I told you I don't allow\Nreading here, Naruto! This is the last test.\NPut all of your effort into it! Yes, boss! Transform! Naruto! It's you again! Why is it always me…? Sorry. Huh? It's because\NI'm the Hokage's grandson. Don't worry about it. Huh? You're now ready to perform\Nthe Sexy Jutsu! You just need more practice. Yes, boss! OK, keep in mind…\Nthe point is for ""boom boom boom""! Now do it! Yes, boss! 					Transform! What do you think? That won't do! More slender. Yes, boss! Is this okay? Not yet. 					More attractive. Yes, boss! How about now? That Naruto… What is he teaching\Nthe Honorable Grandson…? Where the hell could they be…? I am a distinguished teacher\Ntraining potential Hokage. All those who interfere\Nwill be eliminated. You know I've been wondering… You seem obsessed with beating\Nyour Grandpa Hokage. My name is Konohamaru. It was Grandpa who gave me\Nthat name. He named me after our village. It should be easy for everyone\Nhere to remember. But nobody ever calls me\Nby that name. When they see me, all they see\Nis the grandson of Lord Hokage. No one sees me for who I really am. I can't stand it anymore. That's why… That's why I want the title\Nof Lord Hokage now. Idiot…Who do you think\Nwill accept you, huh? Huh? You won't win the title\Nthat easily, you know. What?! It's not that simple. If you're really serious about gaining\Nthe title of Lord Hokage… What? You'll have to beat me first! Lord Hokage!\NI've been looking for you. Iruka. Did Naruto re-submit\Nhis Ninja Registration Form? Yes. When I lectured to him the other night\Nat the ramen stand, he said he will make everyone accept him\Nnow that he's a Ninja. He's been happy since then. It might not be easy for Naruto\Nto realize that dream. Huh? As you well know, only the villagers who fought\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago know that the monster is sealed\Ninside Naruto. I ruled that no one shall speak\Nabout that incident. I have severely punished those\Nwho have broken this rule. Now our children know nothing about it. That is the only positive\Ndevelopment for Naruto. Before the Fourth Hokage trapped\Nthe monster and died, his last wish was for the villagers\Nto regard Naruto as a hero. A hero? The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster\Ninto the navel of a newborn baby whose umbilical cord\Nhad just been cut. As the receptacle\Nfor the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, Naruto saved the village. Unfortunately, the other villagers\Ndon't see him like that. Some even say that Naruto is\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself. Little by little, that attitude has been\Npassed down to their own children. Iruka. 					Do you know? What, sir? When someone is hated and people refuse\Nto accept his existence, he sees it in the eyes\Nof the people around him. I have found you! Huh? That Demon Fox!! That cold look!\Nlt's always like that! Honorable Grandson,\Nwe have to go now. No way! I want to beat Grandpa right now\Nso I can win the title of Lord Hokage! Don't get in my way! A Hokage must first know about virtue,\Nhonor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith, judgment, obedience\Nand all that. He must be skilled at more than\Nthousand techniques… And then... Transform! Take this! Sexy Jutsu! What? 					lt didn't work! What kind of a\Ndisgraceful spell is that?! I am a gentleman! Such vulgar attacks\Nwill never work on me! Honorable Grandson!\NThat rascal will only make you an imbecile! Stick with me and... you will gain a shortcut\Ntowards becoming the Fifth Hokage. C'mon, let's go! No way! Shadow Clone Jutsu Wow! 					Fantastic! Ha! 					That's nothing. I am a distinguished teacher. I am not as weak as Mizuki. Boss… Transform! Transform! Oh, Master Ebisu… I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""! He combined the Multiple Clones with\Nhis own Sexy Jutsu. That's another devious attack. I probably won't even survive that one. I can't even beat that\Nfour-eyed teacher of mine! I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!\NI want to be recognized by everybody! But I keep failing. You think it's that easy? Huh? It's given only to the greatest Ninja\Nin the village. Everybody must learn to believe in you. I've been through a lot already. It's been one struggle after another. But after all that,\NI found someone who accepts me. I had to go through a lot...\NJust for one person. You had better push yourself. For what? The path of getting the title,\NLord Hokage, is a brutal one. There's no such thing as a shortcut. If you're really serious about\Nattaining the title of Lord Hokage You'll have to beat me first. Who do you think you are,\Nlecturing me like that? I won't be your apprentice anymore. From now on, you're my rival. Unfortunately for you,\Ntomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy. Still, I'll consider you an equal someday\Nwhen we fight for the title of Lord Hokage. Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru. You still have a long way to go\Nto become a real Ninja. Aaah! Why do I have to be in\Nthe same group with Sasuke? The guy I hate the most? Sakura keeps saying\N ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!"" and doesn't even\Npay attention to me! It makes me so mad!\NI got it! I'm going to pull one on him!

It’s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu\Nthat can bring the dead back to this world. The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu\Nis that it uses the blood of the caster. But I’ve heard that with this Jutsu, in order to summon\Na dead soul to this world… the body of a living person is sacrificed\Nas a container for the soul. Then, the bodies of those two\Nare of the sacrificed… Right… Perhaps dust and dirt cover\Nthe sacrificial body and take on the original form\Nof the summoned soul. And by way of the charm\Nembedded in the head, the personality of the soul is killed and it morphs into no more\Nthan a killing puppet. They’re complete.

Here I go! Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs. Water Style: Water Wall. No way! To be able to set into motion that level\Nof Water Style in a place with no water. I can’t believe it. True to the title of the previous Hokage. Water Style: Water Shock Wave! Earth Style: Mud Wall. Same mighty strength as always.

You’re finally caught…eh, Sensei. Okay. Everyone’s here, right? Okay everyone, let’s evacuate quickly. Don’t rush and don’t panic! What’s the matter, Konohamaru? Does your stomach hurt or something? No…it’s not that. Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu. Appear! Monkey King Enma. Humph…\NSomething pesky has appeared, eh? Old Monkey Enma. Orochimaru…\NI knew this would happen.

It's not that he didn't use it.\NHe can’t use it. The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage\Nhas differs from the past. The Shadow Clone Jutsu that\Nevenly disperses Chakra, if things go wrong,\Nwould be like throwing away Chakra. Sure enough, is it age?! Are you okay, Sensei? Please hang in there.

7,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart This is quite some fog.\NI can't see ahead. The bridge should be visible soon. When we reach the side of the bridge,\Nwe'll be in the Land of the Waves. Wooow! 					 It's huge! H-Hey! 					Please keep it down. I took this boat out under cover of fog. And I cut the engine\Nand am rowing by hand. If they find us,\Nwe'll be in deep trouble. Mr. Tazuna. I want to ask you something\Nbefore we arrive at the pier. The identity of your assailants,\Nand the reason why they are after you. If you don't tell us… our mission may end\Nwhen you make landfall. The Assassin of the Mist It appears I have no choice\Nbut to tell you. Frankly, I'd like you to listen. Just as you said, this may be beyond\Nthe scope of your mission. Actually, I am being targeted\Nby a terrifying man. A terrifying man? Who? You guys have probably heard at\N least his name before. A shipping magnate\Nby the name of Gato. What? Gato…of the Gato Company? One of the world's richest men? Who? What? Yes… On the surface, he's the chief executive\Nof a shipping company… But underneath,\Nhe is into drug-trafficking and deals in contraband\Nusing gangs and Ninjas. Moreover, he runs a despicable business, ruthlessly taking over nations\Nand enterprises. It was about one year ago… when that man first set his eyes on\Nthe Land of the Waves… He used his wealth and violence\Nto enter this country, and before anyone knew it, he had taken complete control of the island's\Nmaritime transportation and shipping. Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an\Nisland nation like the Land of the Waves, means having control of finance,\Nthe government, the people... everything. The one thing Gato fears... is the completion of the bridge... that has been under construction\Nfor some time now. I see. Since you're the one building the bridge,\Nyou've become a hindrance. Then, those Ninjas from before\Nwere Gato's men…? But I don't understand. Your opponent is a dangerous one,\N who will even use Ninja. Why did you hide that fact from us\Nwhen you made your request? The Land of the Waves… is a very poor nation,\Nand even feudal lords have no money. Of course, we ordinary citizens\Nhave no money either. We cannot afford to make requests of\NRank B or higher... Well, if you pull out\Nof the mission when I land ashore, I will, no doubt, be killed. Killed sometime before I make it home. But there's no need for concern! Should I die, my cute grandchild\Nwho will turn eight... will only cry his heart out! Oh! And... my daughter will only blame\Nthe Hidden Leaves Ninja for the rest of her life\Nand grieve in solitude! Oh, it's not your fault at all! Well... I guess we have no choice. Let's continue as his bodyguards. Oh! I am most grateful! I won! We'll be arriving soon. Tazuna. It appears we haven't been noticed\Nup until this point… Thanks. This is as far as I go. See you around. Yeah. You've been a big help. Be careful. Okay! Get me home safely. Right. When they next attack,\Nit won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin. Cripes! I won't let this guy do\Nall the fun stuff anymore! There! Heh… Just a mouse. Quit trying to show off! There was nothing there\N in the first place! Please, Naruto. Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly. They're really dangerous. Hey brat!\NDon't be doing anything confusing! Huh? I sense a presence there! No, over here?! There! Stop it, already! S-Someone's really been targeting us\N the whole time! Yeah right! Knock it off, you! Naruto!\NWhat have you done?! It's a bunny! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…\NI'm sorry, bunny. It's just a rabbit, eh. That's a snow rabbit. But that doesn't explain\Nits fur color... The coat turns white only during winter\Nwhen there is little sunlight. Which means... that snow rabbit was raised indoors\Nwithout sunlight to be used as a substitution. Guess they're already here… I'm sorry… I see… The Demon Brothers wouldn't\Nbe enough to take on these guys. The Copy Ninja from the\NVillage of the Hidden Leaves. ""Sharingan"" Kakashi is with them… Everyone, get down! If I'm not mistaken, he's… Here we go! Here we go, here we go,\Nhere we go! I'm going to do it this time. I won't lose to Sasuke! Well, well. If it isn't the Rogue Ninja\Nof the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi! Rogue Ninja? Whatever.\NWhat's important now is… Ready… Go! You're in the way. Get back, you guys. Why?! He's on a totally different level from\Nthe guys from the other day. His being our opponent means… Huh? Oh. that things might be tricky\Nas I am now. I assume you are Kakashi,\Nthe Sharingan user… Sorry, but… I'll have you hand over the old man. Huh? Huh? Sharingan?\NWhat's that? What? What is he talking about? Is this guy strong? Sharingan… Get in Manji battle formation, you guys. Protect Tazuna… Don't involve yourselves in the fight. Huh? That's the teamwork\Nin this situation. Huh?! Fight me. W-What's this eye…? Well now... I never expected to see\Nthe rumored Sharingan this soon… This is an honor. Everyone's been saying Sharingan... What is it?! …Sharingan. Power that the light of the eye generates,\Nand the pupil emanates. The user of\Nthe so-called Visual Jutsu (Art) is said to possess the vision to see through\Nall Genjutsu (Illusionary Art), Taijutsu (Physical Art),\Nand Ninjutsu (Ninja Art), and is able to deflect them. The Sharingan is a type of eye\Nthat is unique to the user of the Visual Art. However, that is not the only power of\Nthe Sharingan. Well said. That is not all. What's more frightening is that\Nsuch an eye can assess an opponent's techniques\Nand copy them. When I was in the Anbu Black Ops\Nof the Hidden Mist, search information\Nabout you was in the Bingo Book I would carry around with me. There was also something\Nelse in the book... About the man who has copied\Nover one thousand skills… Kakashi the Copy Ninja. What? Kakashi Sensei\Nis that incredible a Ninja? W-Wow! What does this mean? The Sharingan…is a special trait that appears in only a select few\Neven among the Uchiha clan. Could it be, that this guy… Let's end the talking here. I must kill that old man immediately. But, Kakashi, it seems\NI have to defeat you first. Over there! And he's even on the water? He's building up quite a bit of Chakra! Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu. He's vanished?! Sensei! He'll probably come to erase me first… What is he? Zabuza Momochi. He's a Anbu Black Ops member\Nin the Hidden Mist and is known as ""the silent killing""\Ntechnique expert. S-Silen...? As the name suggests… it's a killing skill that's implemented\Nin an instant in silence. By the time you realize it, it's possible you may find yourself\Nin the afterlife. I haven't totally mastered\Nthe use of my Sharingan. So don't lower your guard, you guys. Well, if we fail, we'll only die. How can you be so carefree?! The mist is steadily getting thicker! The Land of the Waves\Nis surrounded by ocean. So mist rises very easily. Sensei! Eight spots. Huh? What? The larynx, the spine,\Nthe lungs, the liver... The jugular and the subclavian veins. The kidneys, the heart. Now then, which vulnerable spot\Nwould be good? What an intense thirst for blood! If I take even one breath,\Nor move my eyes, I will be marked and killed -\Nthat's what I'm feeling. If I'm stuck like this for an hour,\NI'll go mad! Facing a Jonin's intent to kill… This sensation is like having\Nmy life being held in limbo… No way! I'd rather die\Nto escape this feeling! Sasuke. Don't worry.\NI'll protect you with my life. I will not allow\Nmy comrades to get killed. I wonder about that... It's over. Sensei! 					Behind you! Die! The Water Clone Jutsu? It can't be! In this mist… did he actually copy me? Don't move. It's over. O-Oh no! Even Kakashi Sensei fell under\NZabuza's Jutsu. I've got to escape. I'll get killed, for real. This pain. What am I doing?!

Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something A Town of Outlaws!\N                          The Shadow of the Fuma Clan It seems that the most bustling traveler’s\Ntown in the Land of Rice Paddies is at the bottom of these mountains. You’re going to weird places again in the name of investigation,\Naren’t you, Pervy Sage?! Please stop it already! We had a rough time shaking\Noff the bodyguards from the rip-off bar. I understand your point, but there’s no other way to find\NVillage Hidden in the Sound. Gee, I don’t like it either, but… This is truly a problem… But we have to do things\Nwe don’t like… Right?! Okay, let’s go! Naruto, Sakura,\Ndon’t drag your feet! Investigation, investigation!\NWhat a pain. He looks like he’s having fun. He hasn’t learned at all. Fuma Alley – Oww! 					– That's my line! This is even rougher than\Nthe traveler’s town before. Let’s just take a pass on this place\Nand find Village Hidden in the Sound. Say… I don’t have any more money. I don’t have any more money either! Here! You guys go get some food with that and wait in the temple\Non the outskirts of town. Information accumulates\Nin this kind of place, but it’s not good for you guys to see. I’ll sacrifice myself and check it out. He’s a surprisingly nice person… Sakura… You’re still so naïve. Where should I investigate first? Gee, how rough…\Nlnvestigations are painful. Let’s leave the Pervy Sage be\Nand check somewhere else. What’s the matter, Sakura? I don’t think…\NSasuke’s in this land anymore. What’s the matter?! We won’t know that if\Nwe don’t investigate! Yeah, but… Our opponent is Orochimaru. Of course, things might not go easily. But you know… But I’m sure we’ll find him! Right. Naruto! You’re…the one from before?! This kid’s…hurt… You…? Naruto! Substitution, huh…? We let them get away. Don’t worry… My cute children\Nare making a silver trail for us. They can’t escape from us now… It seems those two are\Npetty Ninja from somewhere. But getting involved with us\Nhas sealed their fate. It’s unfortunate for them… The objective of those who sneak into\Nthis land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway. Sure enough, the skin of\Na young woman is supple. You’re mean! Eh? Oh, sorry sorry. By the way, have you guys heard\Nrumors about the Sound Village? The Sound Village? I’ve never heard the name\Nof such a village. I’ll tip you handsomely if you tell me. But I really don’t know. I’ve never heard of it. I’ve heard of it! One of my regulars knows\Na lot about it. Wanna come? Yeah. His home is in the back of this alley. Trapped like a rat. What, it’s a seedy old man!\NHey! He’s got money, right? Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes. You punks! Stop the idle chatter\Nand take care of him now! Right, boss! Getting infatuated with girls has sealed\Nyour fate! Rest in peace! Ninja Art: 					Needle Jizo. You punk… I’m in a hurry… I think it’d be best if you\Nanswer compliantly whether or not you know\Nabout Hidden Sound Village. You’re a fool if I look like\Na compliant person to you! You a Ninja? If so? Interesting! We’ve reduced ourselves to\Nbeing thieves, but we’re a somewhat\Nfamous Shinobi clan around here! Instead of taking your life,\NI could hire you if you want! A Ninja, huh… Then I don’t need to go easy on you. Don’t be acting like a big shot, old man! Shut up, you squirt! A Ninja refers to one who endures. Those who couldn’t endure\Ntheir hunger pangs and resort to use their diligently\Nstudied Jutsu for stealing are not called Ninja! I won’t let that pass! Thinking we’re fellow Shinobi,\Nwe took pity on you. Acting all conceited! Regret after being sliced in two! Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato! Rasengan! You punk! How dare you\Ndo that to the boss! We won’t let you do\Nany more than that! Oh? Hold it, you guys! I didn’t know you were so good! That Jutsu just now… I sense you must be\Na person of stature! If it’s all right,\Nmay I ask you your name? If you don’t know, then I shall tell you! Women become infatuated\Nwith his sex appeal. He’s strong against Shinobi,\Nbut has a soft spot for women! He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves… And made his name known… Master Jiraiya, that’s me! What?! You guys bow your heads\Nand beg for your lives! We’ll all be killed! – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir! Although we didn’t know,\Nbeing so rude to Master Jiraiya, reputed as one of the Legendary\NSannin of the Leaf Village! We beg for your forgiveness! So my name’s known in this land, too… Well, it’s okay. So is it true that you know about\NVillage Hidden in the Sound? Yes! There were many Ninja clans\Nin the Land of Rice Paddies, including us Fuma. We divided up the roles\Namongst ourselves and the Ninja of this land\Nwere doing well in their own way. Until that man appeared… Who was that man? It’s regrettable to even speak\Nof that name… It was Orochimaru! It’s okay! Rest easy! If germs get into the wound\Nand you get tetanus, you won’t be saved. But fortunately, I have medicine,\Nso let me treat you. They’re not coming. Just show us your wound. Well, huh? Naruto, go wait outside\Ntill my treatment is done.\N164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh? Why do I have to be\Nthe only one chased out?! Jeez! I guess it can’t be helped. Don’t peek! I know. Okay, show me your wound. How mean… To hit me out of the blue…? Whoa, interesting. Naruto! You can come in! What?! A cute girl? Sakura! This girl!\NWho the heck is this girl?! How dense. It’s the Ninja\Nfrom a moment ago. Come to think of it… Why…? I am Sasame Fuma. Sasame… Why were you being\Nchased by those guys? If you like, try talking about it. We might be able to help. They were the Sound Ninja protecting\NOrochimaru’s residence. What?! I’m sorry for mistaking you guys as\None of them the other day. That doesn’t matter! We’re also looking for Orochimaru! Would you please give us the details? Okay… It all started with the Feudal Lord\Nof the Land of Rice Paddies launching an attack on\Na neighboring land in an attempt to expand the territory. The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land… And there aren’t that many Shinobi. It was a foolhardy attack.\NLosing was expected… And the Shinobi clans of this land who participated in\Nthe losing battle went to ruin… We the Fuma Clan as well. I hear that among\Nthe surviving Shinobi, there are those who have left the land and those who have\Nstooped to become thieves. Even so, we’ve lived believing\Nin a restoration of the clan and continued to live hiding\Nin the shadows. At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden\Nin the Sound appeared before us attempting to create the first full-scale\NShinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies. The emissary of\Nthe Sound Village said… My master Orochimaru is\Ngathering all sorts of Jutsu! He has taken an interest\Nin your Jutsu well. Depending on your work, you might be given the chance\Nto serve the Feudal Lord! My cousin Arashi… was an up-and-coming star\Nfor the restoration of the clan… Arashi as a representative of the clan headed for Village Hidden in\Nthe Sound together with the emissary. But… And then…? We waited for a notice from Arashi, but… There is no word from him, huh? Damn it!\NHe was tricked by that Orochimaru! Naruto! Oh…! Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi\Nmight be safe… We don’t know, right?\NAnd so…and so… Idiot…! I’m going to save Arashi! I have a small body and\Nmy power is weak. So no matter what I did… I did nothing but become a hindrance\Neven in Ninjutsu training… But Arashi always saved me! Everyone in the village has\Nalready given up, but… So I’ll find Village Hidden\Nin the Sound alone… And so you were chased by\Nthe Sound Ninja, right? This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi! Sasame! I…I want to be of help to Arashi! Naruto! Yeah…I know! We have to go to Village of the Sound\Nto bring back Sasuke anyway, so! Now instead of one, it’s just that there are two guys\Nfor us to bring back. I’ll save your cousin, Sasame! Right! Eew! A spider… What’s this?! Naruto! Wha--! What’s this?! Ninja Art: Wind Spiders! My cute children made a path\Nfor me out of silver thread and told me where you guys\Nwere going. All three of you together will descend\Ninto hell while bearing the secret! Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu! He’s scattering his voice\Nto multiple directions and covering up location and number! I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Okay! Bring it on from anywhere! It’s a large number,\Nbut it’s just Clone Jutsu. No. Look closely, Jigumo! The threads are getting tangled. All of the clones are tangible?!\NShadow clones?! If so… Kagero! Understood… Come out! Borne to be born, lived to live,\None sunrise and one sunset… The life of a mayfly lasts but one day. Thinking that such a fleeting life\Nis pitiable is, in fact, pitiable… Know that I’m at my best when living in the dark and\Ndeep in the ground! Ninja Art: Ant Lion Jutsu! When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… Darn it! What a pesky bunch! But I won’t be done in so easily! I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt and bring back Sasuke and\NSasame’s cousin! It doesn’t matter if you guys\Nare powerhouses! I’ll kick all of your butts,\Nso bring it on from anywhere! Next episode, “Pure Betrayal,\Nand a Fleeting Plea!”",,,,0.20761041343212128,,,0.19058603048324585,0.17656391975469887

Wait a minute,\Nwait a minute! That's the trap field over there… Yikes! Well! It's because you're so reckless! Geez, you are so much trouble. Zazuge--! If you act up any more, I'll finish you! Mmm…\NTeamwork hasn't been good lately. That's right, that's right! Sasuke, you're to blame for\Nthe poor teamwork! You're always attracting attention! That's you, you idiot. If you don't want to owe me\Nbig time... you just need to become\Nstronger than me! It seems like they're getting\Nalong worse than before... Shoot… 					This is frustrating! There're plenty of guys outside\Nwho are stronger than I am… Always making me go on\Nthis kind of lame mission. Well then... Perhaps we should disperse. I do need to submit a report\Nabout this mission. Okay, then I'm going home. Oh! Hey! Sasuke, wait for me! Hey, how about...\NWhy don't you and… Why don't we work on improving\Nour teamwork together? You're just like Naruto.\N100	01:59:31:10	01:59:35:03\N		JUST LIKE NARUTO If you have time to spend on me,\Nwhy don't you practice a Jutsu! To tell you frankly,\Nyour abilities are less than Naruto's! LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!!\N		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!\N		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto! That's right… It's always that way for me\Nduring every mission. I'll never be able to really\Ndo anything at all. Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,\Nand let's practice together! Huh? Sensei disappeared. Was he being thoughtful? Huh? Pretending to be…a rock? There's no such thing as a perfectly\Nsquare rock with perfect holes! It's totally obvious! Just what you'd expect from\Nthe man I respect!

So, leader!\NDo you have some free time now? Nah! I have to train! What?! You said you'd\Nplay Ninja with us today! Oh…? Is that right? Geez… If I played with these guys\Nthey would make me hang out all day. Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja? W-What is it? So, abilities less than this guy, huh?

Is Naruto getting along with the others? Hmm? Well, he's doing okay. I've been busy lately. I haven't had a chance to see him\Neven once since his return. I'm a little concerned... As you know, Iruka Sensei,\NSasuke is also in our squad, and Naruto sees him as a rival,\Nwhich is a little straining. But, the result is that his abilities\Nare developing significantly. Almost to the point that\Nhe might reach yours, the one he respects! I see… I wonder what it is? Shoot! Right now? These guys… Konohamaru! That hurt, little punk! Stop that. You'll get yelled at later! I'm sorry…\NI was fooling around… What are these two? Hey stop!\NLet go of that hand! Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...

You understand well the attributes of scent.\Nlt figures why I didn’t smell you. And…as would be expected, it’s tough having you guys split up in two\Nto search for me… Damn it… Please wait!

Ninja Art: Water Style.\NWater wall! That’s some Jutsu speed.\NMy eyes couldn’t follow the Sign. That Shuriken in the right hand\Nwas a decoy… to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch\Nan attack below my foot … That’s what to expect from you, Kakashi. Your power of analytical eye…is great. A Shadow Clone?!\NHis Jutsu speed is too fast! A water clone?! The Copy Ninja has done well this far\Nwith Jutsu of my village. Nice! Kakashi! Get down, Kurenai! This one is the Shadow Clone… Huh? Kakashi! Kurenai! He made the Shadow Clone\Nbody explode?! A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu. Sakura’s going to start to like me… Maybe! Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke\Nwill be surprised! Kakashi…! Don’t lower your guard… He’s the guy who became a division chief\Nof Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old… To think he’s this powerful… No, you haven’t seen\Nthis guy’s strength yet. I didn’t expect that you who are not\Na member of the Uchiha clan would have mastered\Nthe Sharingan to that extent… But your body isn’t the “Uchiha clan” body\Nthat goes with the eye. That’s right. As a result,\Nmy stamina doesn't last… There’s a reason why the Uchiha Clan\Nwas deemed the strongest and feared… I’ll demonstrate the true strength\Nof Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai! I-It can’t be! This is bad! Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes! Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes! Both of you,\Nabsolutely do not open your eyes… It’s all over now if your eyes meet. Only people with Sharingan\Ncan have a go with that technique. Indeed with Sharingan, you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan\Nto a certain extent. However… this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan, Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm,\Nis unbreakable. The only person who can bring me down\Nis someone using the same Kekkei Genkai,\Na Sharingan user… Sasuke… I wonder how much you can take\Nwithout the Kekkei Genkai? The one just now was…Genjutsu? In the world of Tsukuyomi… Both space and time… and mass…\NI control them all. For the next 72 hours… I’ll stab you continually with swords. That’s… In the world of Tsukuyomi… Both space and time… and mass…\NI control them all. Calm down… This is Genjutsu. It’s best not to be optimistic\Nand think it’s an illusion. This pain is not an illusion. This pain is absolutely\Nno different from reality. How long will your spirit sustain? There’s…\N71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left. Wha…?! S-Since then…?! That’s all the time that has passed?! What happened, Kakashi?! Are you saying we should keep\Nour eyes closed still?! N-Not…yet… What happened?! Just as that guy finished speaking,\Nyou suddenly fell over! Three days in that world is less than\Na moment in the actual world, huh… But…why doesn’t he kill me? He could easily do so, if he wants to… Whoa…To take that Jutsu without causing\Nhis spirit to collapse. But Itachi… it’s also dangerous for you\Nto overuse those eyes. The thing you’re looking for… is it Sasuke? No…the legacy of the Fourth Hokage… These guys.\NWhat the heck are they planning…? So, Naruto, is it…? It’s been a long time… How many years has it been\Nsince you returned to the village? Kakashi… I will keep Naruto under my care. It was an understandable decision\Nof the Third Hokage who appointed you to\Nthe role of watching over Naruto… But even at your level,\Nyou may not be able to handle it properly. What in the world are you saying? I’ve been observing Orochimaru\Never since he left the village… It was obvious that he would return\Nto this village sooner or later. All told, at first I was concerned\Nonly about him, but… What is it? The guy joined an organization. An organization? What are the details of the organization? I don’t know much of the details, but it’s a small organization known\Nas Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi. Until recently, they weren’t making\Nany dramatic moves except some cloak-and-dagger activities. The biggest concern is\Nthe members of that organization. Almost all of them are listed\Non the Bingo Book, all S-rank deviant criminals. That Itachi is among them. If the nine of them get together,\Ntheir intent will not be volunteer activities. Since you’ve been told this much,\Nyou already know what it means. But recently, Orochimaru pulled out\Nof the organization. And at that time, other members of the organization\Nwent in to action in different areas, in pairs gathering Jutsu and things. Is there proof that one of those\Nthings is the Nine-Tailed Fox? It’s possible. Because it’s one of the spirits\Nwho possess the strongest Chakra… Kakashi… Sooner or later, that Naruto will have\Nto live watching his back… That’s his destiny. For now, you should keep\Nyour eyes on Sasuke. It’s necessary for you to teach him\Nhow to use his Sharingan. I’ll take care of Naruto for a while. The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto\Nis your target? I know that you two aren’t\Nthe only ones on the move… The name of your organization is\NAkatsuki, right? Akatsuki? Kisame! We’ll take Kakashi.\NErase the other two. Severe Leaf Hurricanes! Who are you? The Leaf’s noble, blue fierce animal… Mighty Guy! What a sight…\NShouldn’t you be called a strange beast? Don’t underestimate that man… That man is Itachi! You did this to Kakashi…? Don’t look at Itachi’s eyes, Guy!\NYou’ll be caught up in his Jutsu! I know that already! In order to fight Kakashi,\NI devised ways to battle the Sharingan. Open your eyes, both of you! B-But… When you battle with the Sharingan, it’s not a problem if\Nyou don’t look at those eyes! You work around it by\Ngaining insight into his movements by looking constantly at his feet. Now that you mention it,\Nyou’re probably right, but… You’re the only one who can do that. That’s true… There’s a knack to reading all of your opponents’ movements\Nonly by his feet. But I can’t teach it to you\Nin this emergency. Just get used it right now! What should we do? Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team. Asuma, you are my back-up! Okay! And until the reinforcements of\NAnbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive, I will hang out with you guys. Interesting…\NThat’s some nerve… Kisame… Pull the plug. We didn’t come to have a war. It’s too bad,\Nbut no more of this nonsense. We’re leaving. Too bad… I was finally feeling motivated. It can’t be helped. All right! Here I go! Y-You’re putting too much spirit into it. You’re not training on a mountain retreat,\Nyou know that, right? A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up\Nis the dream we've chosen, right? It's a secondary role, a role in the shadows But in reaching for that dream, let us stay centered,\Nlet us stay true Over and over,\Nwe hung on without giving up Over and over,\Nwe kept coming back up Over and over,\Nwe believed and dreamed Over and over,\Nwe've seen fools There's a super beautiful\Nyoung lady over there! She just winked at us! Look, Naruto!\NShe must be interested in us! She may be cuter than Sakura! – All right, Naruto!\N– Yeah! Go back, train,\Nthen go to bed. You always do that to me!

Over there! Just a little more… This is a mission believe it or not! This is something very important… I beg you…\NPlease let go of it! We have trouble, Lady Tsunade! What is it?! Those papers\Nscattered throughout the village, are the plans that were stolen\Nfrom the carpenter boss. Currently, Shikamaru and his team\Nhave finished collecting all the plans, and rechecking them. But it seems like they have\Ncollected all of them. What is the meaning of this? I have no idea… Lady Tsunade! We have a report from those who headed to\Nthe Hidden Waterfall Village! Was there movement?! Actually, it turns out that it was only\Na large-scale practice run! They are saying that they see\Nno signs of an invasion of Leaf Village. What?! It seems as though they have\Nalready finished their practice run, and the Hidden Waterfall Village\Nis back to normal. So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Village\Nhave nothing to do with each other…? Disengage the S-Level\NEmergency Security Alert! Order all forces back to village! Yes! What in the world\Nwas that man plotting?! Lady Tsunade! What now?! The body that\Nthe Anbu Black-Ops gathered… It's… It’s not Genno…? What does that mean? But I thought that Old Man Genno was\Ncornered by the Anbu Black Ops and blew himself up. He traded places with a corpse that\Nhe had ready right before the explosion… That’s a huge possibility! We’re in the middle of confirming that! Their appearances look similar,\Nbut small details bring up questions! Most likely…it’s another man. Are you telling me\Nhe fooled the Anbu Black Ops! That means, Genno is… He’s still alive! Damn! What is that man up to…? Over there.\NBehind that tree. It’s here! I see… The Old Man Genno used\Nthis hole to get away. He camouflaged it well. If it wasn’t for the Byakugan,\Nwe would have missed it. Not only that… This hole is made so that it closes\Nnaturally by the weight of the earth. If we came here another day later, it would have been\Nextremely difficult to find, even with the Byakugan. And to prove that, you can barely see any sign of\Nan entrance to this hole. Akamaru, can you follow his scent? He’s even got getting rid of\Nhis smell covered… Where could he have gone? Our conclusion is that… Old Man Genno is still alive and there's a possibility that\Nhe's hiding in Leaf Village. He got cornered,\Nand faked his own suicide, and stole the plans so that he could… make all of us turn our eyes outside\Nof the village. He could have already known\Nabout the big practice run in the Hidden Waterfall Village\Nand used that to his advantage. B-But the Anbu Black Ops\Nstarted to mark Genno because they happened to find out that his letter\Nof recommendation was a fake, right? Was it a coincident…? Isn’t it strange that\Na real letter of recommendation was at the house of the carpenter boss\Nhe worked for? Then what is his true goal? If we knew the answer to that,\Nwe wouldn’t be struggling so much… Shikamaru! The only thing I can say now is… The number of Shinobi in this village\Ncurrently is at its lowest ever. We only have a bare minimum\Nof us here! And most of their eyes are\Nlooking outside of the village. Even if Genno was walking around\Nas he was humming on the streets, no one would suspect anything of him. Did he set a trap in the village?! Could the fact that that\Nhe scattered the plans around mean that he’s already done setting his trap? No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes. We can’t leave this place\Nwithout any security, but we have few people… Then where do we look? The Academy. The Academy? Why the Academy out of all\Nthe important facilities in the village? Out of all the sites Genno worked on, only the Academy’s repair plan\Nwas stolen. It’s hard to think that\Nit was a coincidence for it to disappear at this timing. Byakugan! Well? There’s nothing in this room. Then…move ahead to the next room. Byakugan! Seems like there’s nothing in this area Can’t you look at\Nthe entire campus at once? And we have Hinata too, you know? That would be possible\Nif we know what the target was, but we’re looking for\Nsomething suspicious. We’ll have to take the basic route. Hey! Wait a minute! You’re in the way! And there’s too many… people here. Like I said! All I want is for you guys to come outside\Neven just for a moment! Our teacher told us to study on our own\Nin the classroom for today!

What did you say?!\NWe’re also protecting the village too… Naruto. You’re wasting time Let’s crush them! What? The Expansion Jutsu! We’re going to tell on you to our teacher! Yeah, do as you please! Idiot! Let’s practice our Kunai Knives. Sounds good. It doesn’t seem like\Nthere’s anything suspicious… Hurry up! Wait! Come on.\NI’m begging you to leave! Naruto! Where did those kids from\Nthe next classroom go? I don’t know… They were going to practice\Ntheir Kunai Knives. That’s what they were saying. Oh, yeah, yeah.\NThat’s right. They’re practicing their Kunai Knives\Nin a place like that? I’ll do next. Ok. Do your best! Do it! Yeah! Oh, so close. They really are practicing… When we were\Nstudents at the Academy, we used to skip class and come here. The teacher’s couldn’t find us here,\Nit really was great! I read comic books, and took naps… That’s right, I ate potato chips. Well, that’s no good! You can learn something from those kids. Even if the teachers doesn’t see you, you should still commit to your practice! They’re true models of students! Wonderful!\NI’m excited! I’m moved! I’d like to take class with them! We wouldn’t want to interrupt.\NLet’s go. Yeah… Naruto… What? Did they have that before? I’m going to get this one! Ouch! I had it! It seems pretty new. Genno could have made it… I-I’m going to get Neji or Hinata! You guys get out of the way. You’re getting in the way of our practice. O-Oh I’m sorry! I’m next! Byakugan! It’s a Paper Bomb!\Nlt’s hidden behind the wall! What, inside the wall?! It’s completely hidden inside the wall. But then how do you\Ndetonate it…? Oh, there she is. Hey! Hinata! Naruto. Naruto… Hinata, go out with me! Wh-What are you saying\Nat a time like this?! Huh? I-I don't know… Go out with you? You won’t? I-I’m not necessarily saying no… Then I’ll just ask Neji then.\NSee you later! What? There’s a thin thread attached\Nto the Paper Bomb. A thread? It’s probably a special thread\Nused to ignite it. He's probably is going to detonate it\Nfrom a distance… Where is that thread connected to?! It goes around the classroom and… It goes outside…\Ntowards the training hall…? There’s a log standing… This… Could it be?! Neji! Come with me for a second! What is it!\NWe’re in the middle of something… Actually there’s a strange log standing\Nin the training hall over there. We wanted him to check it. That’s the triggering device! Huh? Try loosening up your shoulders\Nand then throw it. Shut up. All right, I’m up next. There should be a target on the log. Yeah, there is. The center of the target\Nis the triggering device! When a Kunai Knife hits the center… the device will activate… And the Academy will explode! So close! If you focus, you’ll hit the target. All right, I’m going to hit this time. Focus… And target! Don’t let anybody hit the target! All right, I hit the target! You did it! Oh? The tip is cracked.\NYou always have to take care of your tools. Damn, I thought that I hit the target. This way! Behind there! All right…\NI’m going to hit it for sure! That’s the spirit!

Why did you get in the way?! Be quiet!\Nlf that had hit the target, the Academy would have exploded! What…? For real? A triggering device in here…huh? When something hits the center,\Nthe Academy explodes. So there hasn’t been anyone\Nwho’s been able to hit the center. We really were lucky. We were lucky, huh?

But that will be your death! Gaara Sensei! With this,\Nall preparations are complete. Damn it. Oh! Gaara! We were contacted by someone\Nfrom the Village of Artisans. It seems ones calling themselves\Nthe Four Celestials, bearing long-withstanding hostilities\Nagainst the Five Great Nations… have completed forbidden research and\Nare attempting to resurrect the ultimate weapon of folklore\Nin the village. It seems the villagers got\Nwind of the crisis and have evacuated to\Na different location. I see. So that’s why the village\Nwas completely empty. So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?

Oh, how I have waited for this time. Now, Shukaku! Give me power! I feel it. This is an amazing power! Cut out the futile resistance. The power of the Shukaku\Nis already mine!

There is a limit to your Kunai Knife, but my water that the earth\Ngives me is infinite. His Ninjutsu is endless.\NSo for now… Wanna run away? Say that you’ll withdraw! You can’t get away. Summoning Jutsu! After them! This way! If you get caught by that water,\Nit’s over for sure! It’s coming around from\Nthis side too. It’s trying to trap us! Run! Run! You’re all going to\Nget eaten if you get caught! At this rate, we’re eventually\Ngoing to be defeated. Looks like we’ve gotta beat him up,\Nafter all. But how are we going to beat him if the attack doesn’t work on him? Damn! Huh? Don't you think\Nthere's something weird about him? Wh-What is? Hmm… I wonder? Don’t be joking at a time like this! Perhaps, is Naruto talking\Nabout his tonfa? Oh yeah, he’s holding his tonfa\Nlike a dowsing rod. That’s it! It’s called dousing. If you concentrate on the item\Nyou’re looking for, it will react to that item and inform you\Nwhen you get near it. Dowsing? I see! Naruto, Choji! We might have a chance to win! Huh? If that tonfa is the secret of\Nthis Jutsu then… Naruto! Let’s rap up the chase! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Idiot. I’m not going to let you get away! I've got you! Seems like you tried to get close to me,\Nbut too bad Damn it! I’m going to prepare\Na special one for you. Wh-What Naruto? Hurry up and run, Choji! Yurinojou! Yurinojou! Choji! Choji! Behind you!\NLook behind you! I said look behind you! Choji! Choji! The fight is over. First, the big one,\NI’ll eat you first. Certainly the fight is over. A fight where you’re going to lose. What?! Right now Choji!\NDrink up the water! Useless, useless. Water will gush out from the ground\Nwith no limits. Why isn’t the water coming out? Like I said, it’s useless. What happened?! The water that will protect\Nyou will not come out of here. Look carefully at the surroundings.. Yes, water does not come out\Nof this craggy place. I’m full! Yurinojou has realized your secret. I also thought something was strange. When I went to check the trap, I decided to take the shortest route\Nthrough the craggy area. It wouldn’t have been strange\Nto run into you there… but that didn’t happen. The answer to that is easy! You made a detour because\Nyou avoided craggy areas where the water wouldn’t come out. The tonfa you hold is a weapon and was a way to find the water\Nthrough dowsing. You lost them and you went away\Nfrom your advantageous places. You mean… The reason why\Nyou cracked my tonfa was… Of course, it wasn’t a coincidence. It was planned by Yurinojou who\Ncalculated your actions. Damn it…! This one will be heavy because\Nof the water! Human Boulder! You did it! Choji! Yurinojou! My ribs are injured, but…\NI’m okay. But there should be three of them,\Nso hurry and get the princess! I got it! Choji, please take care of Yurinojou. Okay! I’ll catch up to Hinata! Let me rest a little. I got it. Let’s wait for everyone here. There’s no need to wait. After we rest a little, you are going\Nto take me to a safe place. But Naruto and the others are not yet… That doesn’t matter! In the first place, everything became\Nlike this because of you guys. Instead of taking the long way, if we had used the merchant people\Nas decoys, then we would have escaped by now! Decoys…?\NBut Kikusuke has already… What about it? If your mission as Ninja is to risk\Nyour life in the line of duty, then Kikunojou should be satisfied. Even though Kikunojou is dead, if I am still alive, then it’s possible to\Nrevive the Land of the Green. Princess. Hinata, you won’t understand how\NI was separated from my parents to be held as hostage in\Na foreign country and how much I was bullied. I realized then that only fools would expect\Nto live off of human compassion. Especially someone like Naruto who is easily influenced by\Npeople’s emotions should be disqualified as a Ninja. He loses his rationality in his goal. Princess, what do you know\Nabout Naruto? Naruto has lived without his parents\Nsince he was a child. He has always lived alone. To be accepted by everyone,\Nto become the next Hokage… he has worked hard…really hard… Despite all that, he didn’t give up and he would never think of\Nliving at the expense of others. He tried and tried. Naruto and I are in different positions. I’m sorry. You’re right, Princess. Hinata… Do you like Naruto? I understand. Let’s wait for everyone here. Princess… That bag must be heavy. I will relieve you\Nof some of the burden. Oh, thanks. I cannot die in a place like this. Don’t you look nice, Ruiga. Jiga… Help me… Brother… Whatever. If you die, Brother Renga and I could\Nsplit the Land of Green’s profits. Jiga… Don’t blame me. W-Wait! S-Stop Jiga…! Hinata! Hinata. N-Naruto… Where is the Princess? That’s what I was going to ask! I said let’s wait here and the minute\NI turned around… Why does a Ninja like you\Nget beaten by an amateur? S-Sorry. Then right now she should be alone… Naruto, we should first go back\Nto the village and get advice from the Hokage. No!\NThere’s no time for that. There are still two Janin left. She’ll get killed if she gets caught. But this really isn’t an official mission. We might not be able to\Nhandle the other two… You’re right… As you say, this may not be\Nan official mission but… she’s trying really hard to escape\Nby herself right now. The things she says and does\Nmay be wrong, but somehow,\NI can’t leave her alone. Naruto, I’ll also… Hinata! Yurinojou got hurt. You and Choji,\Nplease take care of Yurinojou! See you later! Oh! Be careful, Naruto… Right there! I see, you have good instincts. I’ll praise you for getting Ruiga. Are you the second Janin? Oh, I feel honored that you know\Nabout me. Then you should brag about it\Nin the other world. That Mr. Jiga killed you,\Nso it couldn’t be helped. Shadow Clone Jutsu. What? That wouldn’t work. This guy… What kind of Ninjutsu is he using? A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh?\NHow interesting. I’ll put them down as\None of my next targets. I won’t let you do that! How did…? Yup. My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet. It’s like this!

As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost.

Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain The Powerful Helper Old Man Genno… Yes! This is quite good! Isn't it?! Why’d he do something like this? Now this detonator won’t activate. Excellent, Tenten. Now we can sigh with relief. No, it’s still too soon to be relieved. Right… When Genno realizes that the detonator here has been removed… he might activate\Nthe Paper Bombs with some other method and blow up the Leaf. Oh, right. You jerk. Don’t scare me like that, Choji! Sorry. At the moment,\Nit seems there’s no one here who’s picked up on our movements. All right, then put things back\Nthe way they were. Got it. Now then… You guys do the Kunai Knife practice\Nlike before. Don’t hit the center. We know. But we were sure lucky…\NNobody hit the center. But I hit it right in the center yesterday. I bet you were off by a little. What? I don’t know about that.. It hit, I tell you. To think there’d be this many. Lady Tsunade, let’s evacuate\Nthe villagers as quickly as possible. Hey, you’re joking, right? What do you mean? If you do that, Genno might… blow up the remaining Paper Bombs right under the cover\Nof the evacuation confusion. I see. Naruto and the others are removing\Nthe Paper Bombs now. Could you wait for their report? Akamaru? Did you find one? There it is! All right! Attaboy, Akamaru. How’s it coming? Just a little more. Yes! I leave the rest to you. Leave it to me. Did you get it yet, Naruto? Just a little more. Just a little more, I tell you. H-Hang in there, Naruto. Damn it, you little… Hey, what’re you guys doing? Oh, umm… Some money got into the opening. Oh, I’ll get it out for you later. No, no. That’d be dangerous… I mean, there’s no time to waste with\Neating ramen. Th-That’s right. Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn’t it?\NWell, hang in there. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Phew, we got through it well. Excellent, Naruto. We’d like more manpower. It takes too long just with us. But there aren’t any other Shinobi\Nleft in the village. Well, there are some here, though. People of leisure who do nothing\Nbut tell about old stories and complain about\Nwhat the young people do. Huh? Could they be…? Did you get that foul mouth from\Nthe Third Hokage? It’s the job of us advisors to\Ngive advice to the youngsters. What’s wrong with complaining? It seems you have a good nose for\Nvillage crises due to your longevity. You’re plenty older than\Nyou look yourself. Wh-What did you say? You old bag! Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage. We’ve grasped most of the situation.\NWhere should we head to? Then there’s a place\NI’ve been saving for you. Oh ho. I can’t wait. To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten. That’s a powerful supporter. Wow. But scary. Hurry! Youth, full power! The enemy’s in the Leaf! I appreciate it,\Nbut I can’t stand those two. But the removal operation\Nwill proceed swiftly once Guy Senpai and the others who\Nheaded for the Hidden Waterfall get back. It’ll be nice if things were to\Ngo conveniently like that, but… Shikamaru, have you got something? I mean, it’s not ordinary stuff. When and how the hell\Ndid he set them? There are too many Paper Bombs.\NAn abnormal amount of it. No doubt about it. Uh-huh. And there’s one more thing\Nbugging me. We’re overlooking something huge…\NI really get that feeling. Almost. What’re you doing?\NYou’re not supposed to hit the center. That’s right. I’m next. I’ll miss. In your case,\Nyou’ll probably miss even if you aim. How’s it going, Neji? The Paper Bomb removal operation\Nis going smoothly. I don’t see anyone\Nresembling Genno either. I wonder where the enemy is. Making us walk all the way to\Nthe outskirts of town. She must’ve gotten this slave driver\Ntendency from the Third Hokage. A place that wouldn’t be unusual\Nfor old people to tell old stories. I’ll rake her over the coals\Nwhen we get back. But what is that Genno fellow thinking? There’s no point to setting\NPaper Bombs in a place like this. Is that what you really think? What? There was a plan to build a shopping district\Naround here before, right? That talk was over thirty years ago. Hmm?! What’s this? H-Hey, isn’t that…? Yes. Look at this. What is it? The Jutsu form written here is different. You’re right. Now that you mention it, there’s no doubt. It looks the same to me, though. Where are your eyes pointing? It’s the first time I’ve seen this. It’s nothing new to us. Speaking of Paper Bombs,\Nthat’s what they were in the old days. Then this is an old version? It seems most of the Paper Bombs that have been set in\Nthe village are of that type. Everyone, please look closely once more at the locations where\Nthe Paper Bombs were set. Although this is\Na residential area here, there are hardly any Paper Bombs set. On the other hand,\Na large number of Paper Bombs have been set in places\Nwhere hardly anyone lives. What does that mean? In the old plans, that was supposed to become\Na bustling shopping district. What? Could that be…? If you think about it putting together\Nvarious factors such as the antique Paper Bombs, the places where they were set\Nand such… This is a trap that was\Nset thirty years ago. Thirty years ago… It’s just ridiculous.\NNot one person noticed in thirty years. It’s a blind spot. Nobody would ever think that this many Paper Bombs would\Nbe set here in this village. Once buried in a wall, it couldn’t be found unless Byakugan\Nor something was used. Then you mean\Nthe Genno guy tried to use the Paper Bombs someone\Nset thirty years ago? But how did he find them? Thirty years ago?\NCould it be…?! Shikamaru, where are you going? Hey! Wait up. We’re finished here, too Let’s go to the next spot, Hinata. Right. Hinata! What’s the matter? I was using the Byakugan the whole time, so I’m just a little tired…\NI’m fine. Are you sure? Let me see. Oh. You’re kind of feverish.\NYour face is red, too. No, it’s not like that. I’ll be okay if I just rest a little… Really? Then I’ll deliver\Nthe Paper Bombs we’ve gathered thus far\Nto Grandma Tsunade, so you wait here. Okay. I’ll be right back! Ichiraku Ramen The old man was standing here\Nthe first time I met him. I thought he was just\Na ramen-loving old man, but… Hm? Could it be that what\Nhe was looking at then was…? Why in a place like this? Well well… So you found it, huh? Old man? I guess I cannot let you\Ngo back now, can I? Thirty years ago, huh? That’s around the time when\Nmy dad was still the master carpenter. It was probably a time when many outsiders were hired\Njust like now. But I wonder if there are records\Nfrom back then. Anything would be fine.\NA blueprint or a ledger. Hey, Shikamaru.\NWhat’re you talking about? Explain. Why did the referral vanish? Referral? You mean the real referral that became the catalyst for\NGenno being suspected? It was bugging me the whole time. Perhaps the disappearance of\Nthe referral was Genno’s doing. But why was it necessary\Nto get rid of it? It all makes sense\Nif we consider the referral that disappeared was a fake, too. What do you mean? But that referral was always here. So it was Genno himself who came here to work with\Nthat referral thirty years ago. Oh! That is to say…probably. At that time, he used a referral that couldn’t be distinguished\Nfrom the real thing. And then he went to the trouble\Nof making one that would be recognized as\Na fake if compared with that one. Why? Even with old referrals, he would be discovered\Nif reinvestigated again. So he got rid of it right after\Nyou blew the whistle on him. In order to conceal the fact that\Nhe worked here thirty years ago. It’s because at that time in the village, he set as many Paper Bombs\Nas were available. Why? Why’d you do such a thing?! Long ago, there was a village called Heat Devil Village in\Nthe Land of Mountains. This is the village where I was born. Heat Devil Village? You don’t know it? No… The only thing recorded in\Nthe Bingo Book you brought is that Genno’s homeland is\Nthe Land of Mountains. To be precise, Heat Devil Village\Nin the Land of Mountains. The village itself vanished, so it probably ended up\Nnot being recorded. Thirty years ago, the Village Hidden in Leaves\Nand Heat Devil Village were at war. Neither side didn’t give an inch\Nand the battle was in deadlock. We launched a successful sneak attack\Non Heat Devil Village, taking advantage of the absence\Nof their main forces. The tide of the war turned to\Nthe Leaf’s advantage in one shot. The only thing written\Nin the history books is that an armistice was concluded\Nthree months after that. These three months are what’s peculiar. Heat Devil Village should’ve been thinking\Nabout a counterattack before accepting a cease fire. Here it is.\Nlt’s my dad’s diary from thirty years ago. Really? Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully. Here. Thanks. ""A middle-aged man from\Nthe Hidden Sand came ""with a master carpentry referral."" ""His skills aren’t great, but I decided\Nto hire him as I want manpower."" The date is one week after\Nthe Heat Devil Village attack. Then like you thought… Checkmate. This is Genno. It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf and to set Paper Bombs\Nthroughout the village. The operation was for the main forces\Nof Heat Devil Village to invade the Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves at the same time as the Paper Bomb explosions\Nand inflict a devastating blow. I went out to various sites and\Nset Paper Bombs. The Leaf village did not have substantial\NAnbu Black Ops as they do now. So I was able to move about with ease. Right around the time when\Ntwo and a half months had passed, I finished setting almost all\Nof the Paper Bombs… and all that was left was to wait\Nfor my comrades to attack. But my comrades never came. Why? The leader of Heat Devil Village who\Nhad insisted on “do-or-die” resistance; lost his life in an accident. And the man who assumed\Nthe position of leader in his place agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf. What? ""Genno doesn’t show up at the scene.\NI wonder what the deal is."" He disappeared having left\Nbehind the Paper Bombs. As for me, my intention was to\Nimmediately return to the Hidden Leaf. I thought the ceasefire would just\Nbe a temporary thing anyway. But Heat Devil Village would never\Ngive me another mission. Two weeks after the ceasefire, the Village Hidden in the Vale launched\Na sneak attack on Heat Devil Village and it was destroyed. No way! They were targeted at a moment when they were weariest from\Nthe battle with the Leaf. Their defenses were probably\Nalso down due to the ceasefire. ""Two months has passed since… Where did Genno disappear off to…?"" Then why come back to the Leaf Village\Nnow after all this time? You set Paper Bombs because\Nit was your mission, right? If Heat Devil Village is no more, then there should be no reason\Nto go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf! Could it be…someone asked you\Nto smash the Leaf? Rest easy. I haven’t been commissioned\Nor commanded by anyone. Then why? How can I put this? It felt like a waste. A waste? What’s up with that? I’m getting old and I could be taken\Nto heaven any time now. If I were to die as is, I’d be buried in darkness without\Nanyone learning of my traps. If so, then I thought I’d put them\Nto good use before I die. Are you serious? You tried to kill people in the village\Njust for that reason? I can’t believe that! Then treating me to ramen was to… It was to find out about the present state\Nof affairs in the Leaf. Damn you! You jerk! You’ll understand when you get older! I don’t understand!\NAs for me… I won’t ever understand it! I’ll show you my final big job\Nas a Trapper! No way will I let you do that! My friends are now in the middle\Nof removing all the Paper Bombs! I won’t let the bombs blow up! Sounds like quite a struggle. But who said I was going to\Nblow up the Paper Bombs? What’re you talking about?\NYou just said that before you die… I said I would put them to good use.\NYou’re naïve, boy. What? I can put them to sufficiently good use\Neven without blowing them up. Katsu! A Shinobi reads two\Nor three moves ahead and prepares several moves\Nin advance. Remember that! Shikamaru! What is it? The Academy students are saying\Nthey’re tired. What should we do? The Academy students? The Kunai Knife practice, right? What? They were still doing that? You idiot! You were the one\Nwho had them do it. Oh, oh yeah. Then have them\Ngo ahead wrap things up. Rather, it’d be trouble if they were\Nto get lucky and hit the center. Oh! What is it? I get it. So that’s it! It’s unnatural for a guy so prepared to casually entrust the\Nfinal explosive device to pure luck. What do you mean? A Shinobi of Genno’s level should blow\Nit up with the most effective timing. In other words, it doesn’t matter whether\Nthe Paper Bombs explode or not. It’s just a diversion. He’s really after something else!

We need to contact\Nthe Fifth Hokage. To not let the returning forces\Nenter the village. Got it! But… Why? If the Paper Bombs were\Nall a diversion, then the moment he makes his move is most likely when\Nthe main forces return! What?! Shikamaru! Choji! We’ve got trouble! What happened, Hinata?!

Unfortunately, I have\Nan important job to do. Time is valuable.\NI’ll get right to taking care of you. Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail. Gosunkugi, here I come! You can’t move anymore. It’s over. Finish him.

Stay away from him.\NHe’s too much for you guys. How could such a strong guy be beaten? Gosunkugi isn’t a mere thief. He’s a Shinobi, same as us. Shinobi. Sazanami!

What were you gazing at? It’s been a while since\NI’ve eaten Ichiraku ramen! Lately I’ve been away\Nfrom home on missions. The bowl of ramen after\Na mission… it spreads to every muscle of the body\Nand becomes energy for tomorrow. If you eat ramen\Nit drives fatigue away. Ramen! Ramen! Ramen! Ramen! Temporarily closed…? No, it can’t be… I endured all the tough missions,\Nlooking forward to Ichiraku ramen… I can smell ramen! What? You're right! Without a doubt…\NRamen is being made in there! Ramen! Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up!\NBurn Copper Pot Burn! This smell… It’s the smell of a soup that’s never been on\Nthe Ichiraku menu before. Then… It's temporarily closed\Nto develop a new menu? Who’s there?! A large helping of miso char siu ramen!\NWith an egg please. I see… You were looking forward to\Nmy ramen that much. Sorry about that. It’s okay to develop a new menu, but I wish you’d do it\Nafter the shop is closed. Since you came all this way.\NGive this a taste. Could this be… Ichiraku’s new menu?! Let’s eat! Wait a minute! There are rules when you’re eating\Na new ramen for the first time… Rule ♪1! Before you do anything, you must first have\Na sip to taste the soup. – Delicious! 					– Delicious! Next, you have to coat the noodles\Nin soup and eat. Huh? It seems like something\Nis missing… Let’s get to the point. The noodles are outdone\Nby the soup! This well-seasoned, rich soup\Ngreatly surpasses any of Ichiraku’s previous soups! But! The noodles are\Nthe same as always! The balance is very bad. I cannot give it a passing score! That’s what I thought… Oh… Don’t get so depressed… Ayame, water! Water please! Huh? Where’s Ayame? With ramen like this… I’ll never be able to get Ayame\Nback from the Ryonin. Teuchi! He’s just overtired. I had him drink an energy drink,\Nso after a little rest he'll recover. But… I think he should take a break\Nfrom the shop for a while. He’s been using his arms\Ntoo much… Look how swollen this is. Come to think of it,\Nbefore he fell, he said something about Ryonin\Nor whatever did something to Ayame, I think… Ayame is his daughter, right? What’s Ryonin? I don’t know… Ryonin…\NHe’s referring to the Ninja Chef. Ninja Chef? Do you know about them, Choji? I’ve heard rumors about them… One of the problems Shinobi’s confront\Non missions is the problem of meals! Normally Food Pills were brought\Nwith them, but the main role of those\Nare to supply nutrients. They have no taste. If they could eat delicious food\Nwhile on missions, would the success rate\Nof missions rise? Based on that theory,\Nwas born… The Ninja Chef… Ryonin! But what those Ninja Chef\Nhave to do with Ayame? They snatched her away… What?! What are you talking about?! Give us the details! It was two weeks ago… Ichiraku Ramen Welcome! The large serving,\Nhere’s your order! A good job as always, Teuchi! Hakkaku! His name is Hakkaku, long ago we trained at\Nthe same ramen shop… He told me he is a Ninja Chef,\Na Ryonin, these days. Actually… I have a favor to ask you. What is it? If it’s something I can do,\NI'll cooperate. The phantom recipe that\NI heard you developed… Please turn it over to me! Ph-Phantom recipe?\NWhat are you talking about? To a chef, a recipe is\Nmore precious than life! I understand why\Nyou want to hide it! But… please! Give it to me! I really had no clue. But Hakkaku didn’t believe me… Ayame. Let’s get to work\Nopening the shop… What the… What’s this tray? Ayame! I have your daughter. If you want her back,\Nhand over the “phantom recipe!” Damn that Hakkaku! Why didn’t you contact\Nthe Hokage right away! The Hokage could… If I did that, I don’t know what\Nwould happen to Ayame. And he also wrote this\Nin the letter… That if I can serve them\Nsomething impressive, he’ll give up on the phantom recipe\Nand return my daughter safe. But, you've got a way to win? I don’t know. But a chef’s challenged me\Nto a cooking match. I have no choice but to do it. So that’s why you’re developing\Nnew ramen. I was able to make the soup\Nexactly how I wanted to. But…I just can't get the firm noodles\Nthat go with the soup… I can’t get Ayame back like this! The cooking match is tomorrow…\NWhat am I going to do? I can’t imagine an Ichiraku\Nwithout Ayame. Okay! Teuchi! We’ll help you. We’ll make the best ramen… And get Ayame back… From the Ryonin! You guys… I'll teach you the basics\Nof making noodles. Quickly mix the ingredients evenly. If there are discrepancies, there will be variations in\Nthe taste of the noodles. Next… Knead it. If you don’t put this properly\Nthe noodles won’t be firm. Are you okay? It's nothing. Don’t worry about me. And…stretch the noodles! It’s important for them to be\Nof a uniform thickness! So there will be no differences\Nafter boiling… Try it. It’s easy to say it… but to actually make the noodles\Nis not so easy. It takes five years to become\Nan accomplished chef in his own right. To do it by the match tomorrow\Nis completely… When it comes down to it, I’ll have to give up this decrepit body\Nof mine to them. Teuchi… You’re not thinking about\Nwhen you lose, are you? Th-That’s… Because if we are doing this, we’re doing it with the intention\Nof winning, believe it! I absolutely don't forgive people\Nwho hold a girl captive! Cooking comes from the heart. Technique and experience\Naren’t everything! No problem… We’ll show them the real strength\Nof the Shinobi of Leaf Village! Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku! The phantom recipe? You can’t tell by looking at me? I see. How foolish… Let me tell you, ramen like the stuff I ate at\Nyour shop the other day can't win. Is Ayame okay? Father! Ayame! The emotional reunion comes\Nafter the match. I have a favor to ask.\NLet me have some helpers. I don’t think those kids are up\Nto the task, but… Well… That’s okay. Well, let’s start the cooking match! Let’s see if you can satisfy\Nall of us Ninja Chef! There are so many of them… We don’t have time to stand around…\NLet’s begin! The preparation for the soup\Nis done! I’ll prepare the ingredients\Nfor the rest! I’m leaving the noodles to you! – Okay! 					– Okay! Listen. Our noodles determine\Nwhether Ayame will return or not! We cannot fail! Seems like he’s done a good job\Nwith the soup… The delicious aroma is\Nwafting over here. Indeed, it’s whetting my appetite. The noodles are the problem! Can those kids really make noodles that\Nwill go with that soup? First, mix the ingredients! They’re amateurs,\NI thought so! You can’t make decent noodles\Nwith that hand movement! We practiced making noodles\Nall night! But, we didn’t make the noodles\Nwe wanted to by morning… Even so, we have to\Nmake perfect noodles! Hey hey. At least make us\Nsomething edible! Quickly… Uniformly… Without discrepancies! Next, knead it! Hey, Sakura! Look, it’s Kakashi Sensei. Don’t play! Oh… Sakura… Oww! Sakura, you just can’t control\Nyour own crazy strength! It’s your fault for playing around\Nat a time like this! This is… This is…\Nthe last of the ingredients. No problem. This time, let us\Nshow you we’ll succeed! Okay, I’m mixing. Wait Choji! Leave this to me! Naruto… Hey, Sakura… Huh? We are Shinobi, right? So then… Let’s show them\Nthe Ninja way to make noodles! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengen! “Ichiraku” version! Wh-What?! Mixing ingredients\Nwith Chakra?! No, that way he’ll surely be able\Nto mix the ingredients uniformly! And in micro units! Sakura! What? Pervy Sage. Naruto! Cha! Wh-What’s this crazy strength…?! If she does that,\Nthe noodles will become super firm! Okay, Sakura! Choji! I, too…am a Shinobi of Leaf Village! Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands! What?! What outstanding noodles! If those noodles are added to\NTeuchi’s soup, this match would… W-We cannot lose! It’s for the future of the Ninja Chef! Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi! Okay! Leave it to me! Wait a minute! When the ramen is done… Who will you serve it to first? Huh? Who…? Th-That’s right…\NThat’s how it is! That’s how what is? Among the chefs… there’s a cardinal rule\Nnot to be forgotten. The first guest to arrive is\Nthe first guest served! No matter how delicious\Nthe food you make is… if you break this cardinal rule,\Nyou’re disqualified as a chef! True, if a guy who came later\Nwere eating before me, then it would seriously pisses me off. There are 100 Ninja Chefs here… They all showed up at about\Nthe same time! So you have to serve ramen\Nto 100 people at the same time! You’re four people… Can you really serve at\Nthe same time? I said we’re Ninja, didn’t I? Shadow Clone Jutsu! What?! Now! Lift them! – Thanks for waiting. Here you go!\N– Thanks for waiting. Here you go! – Oh… 					– Oh… Th-The taste is the issue!\Nlf you don’t satisfy us, you lose! Delicious! – Delicious! 					– Delicious! I’ve never had ramen this delicious. So then… We win! – We did it! 					– We did it! The truth is… We Ninja Chefs are at\Nthe end of our rope… End of your rope? What do you mean by that? We endeavored to make\Ndelicious meals to eat during missions… We thought to make delicious food,\Nto fill your stomach… that can be eaten anywhere… But we pursued taste too far. It was too delicious, people were\Ncompelled to overeat. And as a result… Ninja gained weight,\Nand it interfered with their missions. And some people are now saying, “we don’t need\Nthe Ninja Chefs anymore.” – Oh… 					– Oh… For us Ninja Chefs\Nto continue, we had to get our hands on\Nthe “phantom” recipe out there in the cooking world! Recipe? If we use this recipe, we can improve the performance\Nof Shinobi without causing a burden. There’s such recipe…? I hear, it’s called\N“the scum recipe.” – The scum recipe?!\N– The scum recipe?! We've gathered information\Nfrom everywhere… As a result, we learned that the scum recipe\Nwas at ""Ichiraku"" which Teuchi run. – What?! 					– What?! I-I don’t know! There’s no reason something like that\Nshould be at my shop! There’s someone who heard it! I've got ""the scum recipe""\Nat my shop, so… Oh… Teuchi…? Oh. I might have that. Are you serious?! I thought so! To be precise…\Nlt’s the “scum removal recipe.” – Scum removal?\N– Scum removal? The trick to making delicious soup… is how well you\Nremove the scum. So I, too, studied a lot. Eventually, I worked out a recipe\Nthat can remove the scum effectively. Usually it's called\N“the scum recipe” for short… I never thought that\Nthis misunderstanding would arise. That’s a pretty big omission. Geez. That’s a stupid punch line… We won the cooking match, so keep your promise\Nand return Ayame! That’s right! Where is she?! Father! Aya…me? Ayame…is that you? Can’t you tell by looking? B-But Ayame is like… The food they make is\Nso delicious, I overeat… Did I gain that much weight? Ayame! Ichiraku’s new menu? The thing we made\Nat the cooking challenge? No, a diet ramen\Nthat’s popular among girls. Diet Ramen? It’s super popular! Oh, come on in, Naruto. You’ve regained\Nyour former shape… It’s thanks to my father’s\Ndiet ramen! Huh? Where's your father? Well… While he was joining me\Nin eating the diet ramen… Hey… Naruto. That’s a little too thin, believe it. The wind blows, Ah… The pain,\NThe memories won’t disappear What should be brought along? Assemble them into a piece.

And I’m going to surpass all\Nthe Hokage from the past, and make everybody in the town\Nacknowledge my existence. I’ve been called a failure and such,\Nbut I graduated splendidly and, as a member of Group Seven\Nled by Kakashi Sensei, I am dealing with\Ndifficult missions every day! Distance from the target? 5 meters. I’m ready anytime. In Group Seven, there is also\NSasuke and Sakura. Since I’m really the only one that shows\Ngreat success, you don’t worry about the other two. I got you! Don’t say such things.\Nlntroduce them properly! Is the target correct? I know, I know. The target confirmed. For example, this guy’s name is\NSasuke Uchiha and he’s a pretentious guy. I heard that he’s one of the last\Nremaining of the famous Uchiha clan, but he really is a pitiful guy, like this… Oh, this was when I transform but... as long as you understand the greatness\Nof my Ninja skills that’s all that matters. Oh, and this is Sakura Haruno\Nwho is in love with me. You know, the more she denies it,\Nthe more I’m convinced it’s true. She hardly tells me how\Nshe really feels about me but, her shyness makes her even cuter! Is that true? It really is true, true. Who’s in love with Naruto?!\NCha! It was a lie after all! I’m sorry… Well, putting that aside,\Nthree of us formed a team and got through a bunch\Nof dangerous missions together. Hey you… What? Oh, Missus! I’ve gotten rid of all the weeds! What? 					What's wrong? Those…those aren’t weeds… Huh? Those are herbs I grew in my garden! Ouch, ouch, ouch! Somebody! Help…! No! Free Fall! You idiot. Trap Field\NDo Not Enter\N		Don't go over there! Hey! 					Please stop! That fool… Geez... All because he\Nstubbornly chose that big dog. This is a dangerous mission? It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto. Yikes ! Well, there were times like that too. Do it over. Transform! Oh, this was when I defeated\Nthe Old Man Hokage. This isn’t going to make a good article. Fine, then you show me how to do it. Fine! My name is Konohamaru… The grandson of the\Ntown’s chief Hokage. Grandfather is the most important figure\Nin the Leaf Village and is the third Hokage. Those who succeed the Hokage name\Nis the top Ninja of the village. Especially the 4th Hokage is a great hero\Nwho protected the village from the demon fox! Hey, hey, hey wait! You’re only talking about other people! I was just about to start on myself! Besides, Bro, you talk too much\Nabout yourself! Of course, I am the star of the article,\Nother people don’t matter! You’re right, Naruto… Of course, you’re going to forget\Nabout me when you graduate from the academy. But you can introduce me for a bit… Oh, yes, yes… He is the first person in the town\Nwho acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei… He’s a really nice person, he always treats me to\Nramen noodles at Ichiraku. Am I just a nice person because\NI treat you to ramen noodles? Oh no…well…that’s… Don’t laugh it off! Big brother, next up,\NI’m depending on you! Oh, you’re right! Then, I guess I could talk\Nabout Sasuke’s stories of failures… I’ve already heard that one.\NGet more serious! That Naruto…! I bet he's just making up\Nstuff as he pleases… Humph! Who cares… This is good-looking Kakashi. How is the situation over there? This is cute Sakura. Naruto is somehow managing\Nto fill up the time. More importantly, how is it over there? Are we going to make it in time? We’ll be able to deliver by the\Nend of the commercial break, I think. Oh and don’t forget to tell\Nthe viewers about the present. Roger that. Kakashi Sensei…\NKakashi Sensei, please respond. I wonder what happened? He said that he’d be back by\Nthe time the commercial ended. It can’t be helped.\NSakura, you have to continue. What, me?! Sakura do your best! Why are you there?! Well, it can’t be helped,\NI guess I’ll have to do it. Chapter of Ninja Art Well, now we’ll have Sakura Haruno, who is my senior as a Kunoichi,\Nteach us about Ninja Art. Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi,\NSakura Haruno. Beautiful? What, you have any complaints? Oh, no… Transform! Well first, Naruto’s Ninjutsu... Sexy Jutsu, Shadow Clone Jutsu! Shadow Clone Jutsu. Transform! - Transform!\N- Transform! - Transform!\N- Transform! Harem Jutsu… I call it, “Harem Jutsu”! And something like this. Hey! It’s his fault that he’s late! Dropping the blackboard eraser… Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke, who graduated as\Nthe top student at the academy. You won’t get me by attacking\Nstraight on. The most popular one in class, he can\Nalso fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal. Sasuke is awesome! Your Sasuke introduction\Nis taking too long. Naruto, you're so noisy. Stay quiet. Horse! Tiger! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! What?! That’s not a Jutsu Genin can use… He couldn’t have enough Chakra! Demon Wind Shuriken\NWindmill of Shadows. Shuriken won’t work on me. I’ll do it. C-Could that be…? Sharingan! Is that, the Sharingan…? If this is the same Kekkei Genkai\Nas Kakashi Sensei’s… he can read Bushy-Brow’s Jutsu! Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…\Nit’s some kind of magic either way. I’ll reveal that! Although you have seen Sasuke\Nusing powerful Jutsu like Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu,\NDemon Wind Shuriken, Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan, the greatest of all is... the sharp look of his eyes! Any girl who has been stared\Nat with those eyes, will fall in love with him! Sasuke! 					Look this way! You’re... annoying. Well, that cold behavior is also\Nanother attractive quality of Sasuke… Next is our teacher,\NKakashi Hatake Sensei, also known as\Nthe Copy Ninja Kakashi. He uses the Sharingan in his eye\Nto assess the enemy’s technique and copy over\Na thousand Jutsu techniques. But he’s always late to meet people,\Nand whenever he has any time he always reads this questionable book\Ncalled Make-Out Paradise, and he always looks like he\Ndoesn’t really care about things… Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu: A Thousand Years of Death! And the biggest mystery of all\Nis his face hidden under that mask! I wonder what he really looks like… Ninja Art, Summoning,\NEarth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu! If you can’t use your eyes or ears,\Nsimply use your nose. That’s what happens when\Nyou’re closing your eyes in the midst of fog. This is the Summoning Jutsu\Nspecialized for pursuit. On top of all that, why does he\Nhave the Sharingan in his left eye that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan? One mystery after another when\Nit comes to this person, so many things that I don’t understand… I should ask him next time\NI have the chance. Lightning Blade! What the…?! His hand is…\Nvisibly overflowing with Chakra! You are too dangerous. Water Prison Jutsu. Oh no! Secret Jutsu. Crystal Ice Mirrors! Next up are the Ninjutsu of\Nthe other Ninjas besides us. There’s such a diverse collection of\NNinjutsu that I have no time to explain all… Chapter of Rivals Please, Sasuke,\Nwhom I feel is like my future self, take care of the next part. Sure. After all, I have be the one\Nto do something about it. I knew that from the beginning. Don’t try so hard to look cool. Sasuke, the snob. Don’t interfere. Stay out of it, loser. Annoying. Shut up! I hate the fact that only you stand out. Nobody strong around you\Nshows any interest in you. What the…?! Just watch this. Hey! You there…\NWhat’s your name? I’m Gaara of the desert.\NI have an interest in you as well… What’s your name? Sasuke Uchiha. Hey, you there.\Nldentify yourself. Dang it!\NAgain? It's always about Sasuke! When asking someone his name,\Ngive your own name first. You, with the unpleasant look. Wait a minute! Why don’t you fight with me here now? I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow.\NBelieve it! The one I want to fight isn’t you…\Nlt’s Uchiha. Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke!\Nlt's annoying! It’s true! Nobody thinks that you’re\Nthe main character leader! That’s not true, they’re all just blind! Huh… As usual you’re just about\Nthe talk and not the walk. That’s not true! Leaf Whirlwind! See, you are just about the talk. Uhh… even Sakura is picking on me. The students who gathered for\Nthis Chunin Exam are all skilled, and are the cream of the crop… Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,\Nlno Yamanaka, Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru,\Nand Shino Aburame… You won’t never be able to win\Nwith the way you have been fighting. You must understand that, right? Y-Yeah! Of course! You, too. Be careful not to let\Nyour guard down so you won’t be defeated\Nby some lame guy! Huh! Of course! That’s right… We passed the first stage\Nof the Chunin Exam and are heading to the location\Nof the second stage… No matter what kind of adversity\Nmay lie ahead, we will not be afraid! And we will pass the exam\Nto become a Chunin! Because we... we... have the greatest teamwork\Nthat was formed by a strong bond! Okay! Let's go! Thank you so much for cooperating\Nwith the interview! – Thank you… 					– Leader! Do your best! Yeah leave it to me! – Bye! 					– See you! – Do your best!\N– Good luck! Oh guys… I’m sorry I’m late. A cute girl started talking to\Nme on the way, and I danced for a bit. And that’s a lie! Well, don’t say that… I did bring the VTR like I said. You have to praise me. Yes, Kakashi Sensei you’re great! Now we can see the rest of the show! Everybody look forward to it! Oh, before that the commercial break… Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry, and you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? The 44th Training Field,\Nalso known as the Forest of Death. From here on it’s a serious battle\Nbetween the Ninjas, anything could happen! It’s going down in earnest now! This is getting interesting! A life-risking survival game in the forest! I will survive without fail! Next time: “The Chunin Exam Stage 2:\NThe Forest of Death!” As for me, I’m going to kick butt again!

116,"Connecting old words\Nthat have been used up I just want to convey\Nmy simple thoughts That day's faint wind blows away at the castle ruins of yesterday I'll laugh with you\Nand live for the moment Still that incident\Nwill continue to trouble you, right? That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms! Uh-oh! 8 Trigrams 2 Palms! 4 Palms! 8 Palms! 16 Palms! 32 Palms! 64 Palms! What’s going on?! A golden body surface…? It’s the same material as the weapon\Nhe spit out of his mouth earlier… That was close. I hear that if you’re hit straight on\Nwith Gentle Fist, your Chakra Network gets damaged and you become unable\Nto build up Chakra… That was close. Are you a monster? It seems to come\Nnot just from your mouth. Gum Style Spider Thread… is a metal that hardens\Nthe instant it leaves my body. Moreover, it doesn’t let Chakra through. And…it can be secreted\Nnot just from my mouth, but also from the sweat glands\Nthroughout my body. Attacks on Chakra points won’t work.\NNow it makes sense… The Spider Web Net won’t work. And there’ll be no close-range\Ncombat fighting against a Gentle Fist opponent. In other words, I just have to attack the blind side\Nfrom long distance. There’ll be no sound…\Nlt’ll be in a flash. The game’s over. The Kunai Knife is a fake! What?! 8 Trigrams Palm… Rotation! Wha–?! What is that?! Does he…have eyes behind him?! And the defense just now… He repelled physical attacks\Nwith Chakra?! 360 Degrees of Vision:\NThe Byakugan's Blind Spot! If we’re not prepared for\N“one person, one kill,” then it’s not going to work out… That’s what you said earlier. Hurry up and go!\NI’ll catch up with you all! We have to be prepared for\N“one person, one kill.” Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me. Neji… Catch up with us, no matter what! Can he see me?! What the heck is he?! I know you’re there. Come out. Those eyes… It seems they can do more\Nthan just see through the Chakra flow… So I see there was\Nan extraordinary Visual Jutsu user. A long range battle\Nis unfavorable… I must bring this to\Nclose combat by all means. Very well. I’ll acknowledge that this game has\Na somewhat high level of difficulty! I too shall go for it seriously… It’s like he’s a totally different person\Nfrom before… His Chakra activity is overwhelming. And those markings… His move earlier… He dodged an attack aimed\Nfrom behind and was able to see me hiding\Nin the shadows. In other words, he has a combined wide range\Nof sight and X-ray vision. And what’s more, that Jutsu… If so… Summoning Jutsu! Your ability… I’ll find a way to impeccably assault it. If he defends\Nagainst physical attacks with a large emission\Nof Chakra and its Rotation… all I need to do then is to stop\Nthat Chakra Rotation! Scatter! Rotation! It’s starting to stop. Here! Die! He released the Chakra just in time\Nand repelled the Kunai Knife! To think he’d stop my Chakra Rotation by binding it with Chakra threads… These things… I just have to cut them for now. If the Rotation won’t do, then I just have to dodge\Neach and every one. This guy uses\Nclose-range Taijutsu-style combat . There will be no problem\Nif I fight him from afar. In that way…\NI’ll have a good long look at your ability. 8 Trigrams, 64 Palms! What a number! Hm?! His stance changed?! 8 Trigrams. 128 Palms! He’s fast!\NThe number of strikes has doubled…! If I get nailed by that straight on,\Nit'll be the end for me. If that’s the case on his end, then it’ll be a battle of numbers\Non this end, too! The number’s too great!\NI won’t have enough time! The Rotation’s no good,\Njust as I thought… It seems he has 360-degree vision. And it seems he deals\Nwith enemy attacks by combining his X-ray vision ability\Nfor seeing through things and his telescopic vision ability\Nfor long-distance sight. Furthermore, although\Nhe’s got 360-degree vision, that vision has a formidable extent… If I were to determine the range\Nfrom his reaction before… he almost unfailingly detected\Nthe Kunai Knives that entered the approximately\N150-foot circumference around him. But for some reason, there are Kunai Knives\Nhe can’t evade completely. If so… 8 Trigrams, Sixty… I see… This time, there’ll be even more. This time, two will hit… I’ve found a way to impeccably\Nassault your ability! It seems that defense technique was something to compensate\Nfor this weak point! In other words...\NYour Visual Jutsu isn’t perfect! Why even bother?!\NI’ve won the game! Come on. Are you going to\Nkeep at it for naught? The fate of the small fry character in an\Neasy game is to be destroyed right away! You can’t beat me! – I-I’m not done yet.\N– Lee… You never give up do you? No way you can beat him.\NHe’s a genius unlike you. Genius? What is genius anyway! Even without any talent,\NI’ll surpass “genius” by working hard. It’s no use, Lee. No matter how hard you work,\Nyou cannot beat me. It’s already decided. Lady Hinata... You’re the sheltered little baby\Nof the main branch. A person can never change. And then, this match… Your destiny was decided at the point\Nwhen I became your opponent. You don’t know until you try! This is the end… Gentle Fist! Small fry character one…\NDestruction completed. Well, for a crummy game,\NI was entertained… Heh… I missed the fatal spots, huh? And he wouldn’t easily die from\NKunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh? I see…\NHe’s still going to entertain me, huh? This is thanks for that. Seriously, that fat Jirobo\Ncan’t be helped, but what’s that clod Kidomaru\Ndoing anyway…? That lowlife! He’s got the habit of playing games. Maybe he’s found someone\Nto entertain him? When that idiot plays too much, he becomes hyper\Nand easily gets into that state… But still...\NOnce he gets to the second state… it’s instant death for the opponent. Maximum destructive power…\Nwith 100% accuracy! Die! For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words Would you think it was\Na bother if I approached you? Despite my doubts,\NI worked up my courage My clumsy attempts with words You listened without turning away No wonder I get carried away by you But you don’t feel anything for me, do you? I feel so sad But… For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you He doesn’t carry out wasteful attacks. And he accurately reads\Ninformation from the results. No mistake, this guy’s the strongest\Nof all I’ve fought up until now! I probably won’t be able\Nto evade the next attack. I’ve had enough.\NI can’t dodge it anyway. Since the secret of my eyes\Nhas been discovered, I won’t run or hide!

If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying Then I want to deliver you a smile,\Neven if I’m not by your side Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,\Ninto your hands I can feel it so close, Our two hearts The Bewildering Forest Hey kids, get out of here\Nif you don’t wanna get hurt. Better not think lightly of me! I’m not gonna hand this guy over,\Nno matter what! Ninja Dropouts… It’s not gonna end up with\Nyou just getting hurt. You’re gonna get killed. Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu! Ninja Art: Blood Rain. Todoroki! Damn! My Jutsu isn’t Ninjutsu. It’s Killer Jutsu. Sakura! Lee, are you all right? Yeah, just barely.\NMore importantly, where’s Naruto? Is everybody safe? Yes. However, Commander Todoroki\Nis nowhere to be seen! What was that?! Naruto… Naruto… Die! Damn! Let go, you jerk! Naruto! Damn! Father! Mother! Akio! Akio! What a shame… You’re not getting back\Nwith your comrades. Todoroki! Gantetsu! Are you all right?! Y-Yeah… We’re fine. What are we going to do now? We’ve gotten separated from\NSakura and Bushy Brows… There isn’t any question in my mind. It’s my mission to deliver\Nthis guy to the capital. But the ship’s been destroyed, and… Those guys are pursuing us! What are you doing?! If they’re gonna steal this guy\Naway from us anyway, it would be better to\Ntake care of him right here! What do you mean take care of him…? Even if we delivered him the capital, it’s certain that\Nhe’ll be sentenced to death… Therefore… Rather than having them\Ntake him away, it would be better to…! It’s not set in stone that\Nthey’ll be able to take him away! Let’s go! Your mission is to guard this guy, right? That’s exactly what my mission is too! If you so much as try anything,\Nyour head’s gonna roll! Run! We’ll be fine…\Nnow that we’ve come this far… Looks like we’ve totally lost them. We’ve gone pretty deep\Ninto the forest, haven’t we? I can get our bearings from\Nthe position of the moon. It’s too dangerous to go back\Nto the river. We’ll continue straight through\Nthis forest to the capital. Because it’s my mission. Are you sure it’ll be okay? What do you mean? You said earlier you were going\Nto finish this guy off, right? I was talking about\Na worst-case scenario. Got it…\NWell then, let’s get moving. I wonder if Sakura is all right… Naruto… It’s Naruto…\NHe’s gonna be just fine. Yeah… So let’s hurry up and link up with him! Lee! I detect something strange… Where…? Up above! Lee! Let’s follow him!\NThe enemy might have captured Naruto! What’s the matter? We’re walking in the direction\Nof the moon, right…? Then why is the moon following us? That’s strange… What’s going on…? The Forest of Bewilderment… Once you get lost you can\Nnever find you way out again. He talked… You are in custody.\NYou’re not allowed to talk! Wait a second! The Forest of Bewilderment… You know something about this place? What do you know? Tell us! The Ninja Dropouts have\Na hide-out in this forest. What was that?! So we were escorting you\Nthrough Ninja Dropout territory…?! This forest is perfect for a hide-out. The fog, the winds that\Nsweep through the forest, the extreme magnetic fields… They all make a person lose\Ntheir sense of direction. A person finding himself in\Nthis forest for the first time will never find his way out. I don’t believe that… There’s no way we won’t find\Nour way out…? You guys won’t. Huh? But for me, a member of\Nthe Ninja Dropouts… the outcome will be different. I will… I will guide you through this forest. Yeah, that’s right… For you, a Ninja Dropout,\Nthis forest is like your backyard, right? Okay then, let’s have you guide us! Are you some kind of idiot?! It’s true… The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts\Nshowed earlier on makes sense if you think\Nthat this is their garden… And I’ll believe you when you say\Nyou have a hide-out here. Then even more so… Even more so, it's a no! Huh…? Don’t you get it? This guy is gonna pretend to\Nbe guiding us out of the forest but will actually be taking us\Nto the hide-out. Todoroki… This is an emergency situation… If we don’t kill him, we’ll be killed. W-Wait a minute! Nobody’s gonna care…if this guy dies! Todoroki! What’s that…? I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts\Nhad stolen up to now… So I was tortured… Those guys don’t want to rescue me… They just want to get that money\Nback from me. Once they have the money back,\Nthose guys will kill me too. Do you really think I’ll believe that? Wait a second! The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is\Nhere in this forest, right…? Which means it’s like\Na backyard to them too, just like it is for Gantetsu… Which means that… Which means that what? Well, since we've trespassed\Ninto their garden it’s likely that the Ninja Dropouts\Nwill come after us whether Gantetsu’s\Nbetrayed them or not… So I think our only option is to\Npin our hopes on this guy… Am I wrong? Hey, are you sure\Nyou know what you’re doing? Yeah, everything’s fine. Those guys won’t figure out\Nthis kind of circuitous route. Can we really trust this guy…? What?! I’m used to it’s venom. It’s nothing. Are you really gonna be all right? Yeah… Hey! What’s the matter? No way! You fell for it. You fell for it! Here it comes! Ninja Art: Crimson Mud! Die! You’re the one who fell for it! I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu\Nand the Transformation Jutsu. What was that?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Now it’s my turn! Rasengan! I’m gonna strike you down! Don’t think it’s gonna be that\Neasy to strike me down! Like I'll let you get away! Naruto! That guy! Trying to get away, huh! What are you doing? Th-That sound is… What?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan! Thanks to you we made it…Gantetsu. What's with you guys? They want to fight, it seems. I won’t… I won’t be fooled.\NYou…you… We’ll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu. Todoroki! Stop it, Todoroki! You said you were going to deliver\NGantetsu to the capital, right? This guy… There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy! What are you talking about?! This guy… This guy killed my family…\Nhe killed my little brother! Wh-What was that…? Gantetsu… The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by It’s true that Gantetsu may be evil, but how is taking revenge out\Non him going to change things?!

Hmm… so that’s why you guys\Nwere chased out of your village. Yes. It was probably Orochimaru’s idea\Nwe were chased out of our village as traitors who were getting\Nin the way of a revival of the clan. When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor, I knew that Sasame had ties to a group\Nthat was on Orochimaru’s side. Fool! Hey, Pervy Sage! Just wait a minute! I’m prepared! Sasame, you did it so that\Nyou could meet Arashi… Isn't that so? I’m sorry…\Nthat was the only thing I could do. Master Jiraiya! Sasame did it only because\Nshe wanted to see her cousin.

That is the punishment given to you. Master Jiraiya… Pervy Sage,\NI’ve gotta give you more credit! Thank you, Master Jiraiya! Well, Hanzaki treated me to\Na lot of special service at the Fuma Bar and asked me to look after Sasame… I thought it was something\Nlike that anyway! I feel cheated that\NI gave you more credit!

If three large rats go, we’ll stand out. First, let’s send out one\Nthat won’t stand out. Summoning Jutsu! Hey! Th-The frog spoke! Hey, it’s been a while!\NSakura, this is Gamakichi. Gamakichi?! I wanted to ask you to do\Nsome reconnaissance. All right! That’s a simple task.\NLeave it to me! I can’t help it,\Nfrogs give me the creeps … There doesn’t seem\Nto be anything fishy… There doesn’t seem to be\Na trap at the entrance. Arashi… There’s nothing to it around here. Hmm… What shall we do? It seems there’s no choice\Nbut to split up into three. My instinct tells me\Nit’s the middle one! Wait! What the heck?! At times like this, it’s especially\Nimportant to move carefully… All right, I’ll go this way! That’s it?! So what’s so different from\Nmy instinct and that, Pervy Sage? Well, it’s a question of feeling… If you haven’t found anything\Nafter 30 minutes, come back. Got it? Yeah… Naruto, Sakura, the two of you\Nshould proceed together. Listen, from this point forward,\Nit’s the first avenue of hell. A demon might appear,\Nor a snake might appear. Take them on mindfully! Yup! I understand! We’re going down the middle! Then I’m going this way… See ya … Hmm…the smell of face powder. I’m being invited in… In that case, it might be good fun\Nto accept the invitation. What…? Because guests would be\Narriving from far away, I was directed by Lord Orochimaru\Nto entertain. I’m guessing\Nit's a type of fox raccoon ghost… If you’re saying\NI’m some raccoon or fox, you ought to come over here\Nand check to see if I have a tail or not. Oh, this path was right on… How about yours, Naruto? Sakura, be careful! There’s no telling what sort\Nof traps there might be… Yeah… – Oh?! 					– Naruto?! And you were the one who\Nsaid to be careful! It was an ingenious trap floor! Oh! What the hell is next! Sakura! Naruto! It’s my fault… Naruto! What the hell… I can’t get out… What’re you doing?! You screamed in such\Na misleading way, I totally thought… Give me a hand! You’re really a handful! Ya saved me… Really! I’ll go first! Naruto… It’s all right now. Here! Huh?! Naruto! Naruto! Naruto! Sakura… Naruto?! Are you all right? Don’t worry about me. You need to hurry and\Nget out of this trap hallway! But… I said go! I’ll follow behind for sure! Really? Yeah… I’ll catch up in no time! You’d better come, no matter what. It’s a promise, you know… The sake doesn’t seem\Ntampered with. So what kind of plot has been prepared…? Just as I’d expect from\Nthe Village Hidden in Sound… Are you planning to put a Jutsu\Non me using music? The music isn’t only for guests.\Nlt’s for myself… I see… What do you play for your heart? Music for my own funeral… Trying to seduce me….\NYou’ve underestimated this Jiraiya! Escorting the guest to\Nthe underworld is my last mission. A suspended ceiling?! I need to hurry up\Nand get out of this place! Shadow Clone Jutsu! This is torture! What the hell?! Give me a hand! We need to build up our Chakra\Nand create the Rasengan! Don’t be absurd! We can’t stretch\Nour bodies beyond this! My muscles are cramping up! Man! I’ve gotta do something… – What! 					– Huh?! What?! – Water?! 					– Water! Looks like I’ve been saved. Hey, get outta my way! Oh, it’s you, Naruto. Gamakichi, is there\Na way out somewhere? Don’t know!\NI was flushed down here too. So it’s no good… Hey, are you all right? How could I be all right! Naruto’s taking a long time. Maybe I should go back… It's admirable that\Nyou made it this far, Sakura. Is that Kabuto’s voice?! Isn’t it ironic? During the Chunin Exam\Nin the Village Hidden in the Leaves, you were the only one\Nthat dragged the team down, but yet you’re the one\Nto make it this far. I’m not by myself! Naruto and Master Jiraiya\Nwill be here right away! Where’s Sasuke?\NHe is all right, isn’t he? Shouldn’t you be worried about\NNaruto and Master Jiraiya, and not Sasuke? Well, it may very well be that those two\Nare no longer in this world anymore. No way… There’s no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto\Nwould be taken down that easily! I wonder if that’s so? Maybe you dragged Naruto\Ndown like you always do? So I’m right … Naruto… If you’re worried\Nyou should go and see… Or perhaps you’re afraid\Nof me attacking and you can’t come out\Nfrom behind the pillar. If someone like you were\Non my team, I don’t know how many lives\NI would need. I can too… I can too! Substitution Jutsu?! Substitution again?! I can too…\NWhen I fight, I fight! As I thought, this is all you’ve got… It’s about time I put an end to this. I can’t keep Lord Orochimaru waiting\Nfor no reason any longer, you see. Orochimaru?! Now…shall we see… just who will be stealing\Nscrolls from whom? We’ll fight to the death! No! I’m different from how I was…then! I wonder if that’s true… It can’t be… Even if you put up a bluff,\NI can foresee … You are already…finished. When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… I’m scared.\NWhat is this intimidating feeling? My legs are weak and\NI don’t have any strength in my body. I thought I’m not the same person\Nas I was in the past. I must stop. Calm down.

181,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Byakugan! Why did you take down Naruto\Nwith her?! It was an accident… Had I not applied the finishing blow\Nto her at the moment, we would’ve been in danger instead. I know of no instance of the Ninja Art: Kujaku\Nbeing defeated up until now… He will be missed. Hidden Leaf Shinobi,\Nyour mission is over. I still haven’t taken back the star. We’ll search for it by ourselves.\NThank you for your help. Hoshikage: The Buried Truth Rest easy…\NI’m not an enemy. Come to think of it…\NWhat happened after I fell off the cliff? Could it be…?\NDid you save me, lady? Yes… I see.\NI don’t really remember, though… Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks. I’m Naruto, a Ninja from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves and… Umm, I came to protect the star, but… You kind of stole it, lady… I’m Natsuhi… Natsuhi? What?\NI’ve heard that name before… Oh! That red star’s sure pretty. Natsuhiboshi…\Nlt watches over me all the time. It’s the same name\Nas Natsuhiboshi. If I remember right, Sumaru said it’s a star\Nthat protects him! Sumaru said that? Yeah! Say, lady…\NDo you know him? Sumaru is my child. What?! So, you’re Sumaru’s mom?! What?! Sumaru escaped?! I am very sorry. I was careless thinking\Nthe muscle relaxants were still in effect. Most likely the guys from\Nthe Hidden Leaf are the ones who took him away… What do we do? It’d be bad news if these circumstances\Nwere to be known by the Leaf, no,\Nby those in our village. We’ve got to look high and low\Nfor Sumaru right away. There’s no need to get rattled… We can take care of them at\Nour leisure after we find the star. I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden\Nin the Leaves something like they died during the mission… We could also convince Sumaru. I burned Natsuhi’s Chakra\Ninto my memory… We’ll reach the star if we follow the remnants\Nof her Chakra. Naruto was…? Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi\Nwho stole the star. But I didn’t see them\Nin the Valley of Death… Are you saying they escaped from\Nthe valley where the poison gas swirls? Perhaps. If that’s the case, they might have crossed the border\Nand escaped safely to the forest… Hey, let’s all look for them! What’s the deal, guys?! Naruto helped all of you,\Ndidn’t he?! But if we don’t have an order\Nfrom Lord Akahoshi… Right? Yeah… We don’t have time to be waiting\Nfor an order! I’m going! I’m going… I’ll go too, if it’s to look for Naruto. Mizura, you can’t. I want to be useful in some way. No… I’ll go. Sumaru?! You’re okay! We safely rescued him from\Nthe Hoshikage’s medical room where he was being held! What? Why was he in\NLord Hoshikage’s medical room? It wasn’t a Ninja from\Nsome other village who knocked you all out\Nand took Sumaru away! Akahoshi, the leader of your village\Nwas the culprit! In other words, the Shinobi\Nwho made off with the star and the Shinobi who attacked all\Nof you were different people. That’s what Neji deduced\Nword for word. Why would Lord Akahoshi…? Why would he do that to us? What does this mean, Sumaru? I don’t know, either! But it seems Lord Akahoshi\Nis hiding something from us… Isn’t it about time you guys realized it? Akahoshi’s using you as he pleases. Mizura is not the exception. If you guys continue\Ntraining this way, everyone will collapse and then… No way… It can’t be. That’s a lie! Lord Akahoshi is not that\Nkind of person, ever! Perhaps the Shinobi\Nwho stole the star will tell the truth. Let’s find the Shinobi who disappeared,\Nwhatever the cost! The forest in the Land of Bears\Nis deep. If only outsiders go,\Nthey’d just get lost. Okay, work with us. So leave this to me. But… You rest now. At some point, the time will come\Nwhen we’ll need your help. How about it, Akahoshi…? Were you able to get a lead on\Nthe remnants of Natsuhi’s Chakra? This is good. I guess this is what’s called\Ngood old home-cooking. There’s more. One more bowl! But why’d you do something like\Nsteal the star, Sumaru’s mom? This is not the first and only time\NI took that away. Ten years ago as well… Huh…? Training utilizing that star was painful\Nfor many Shinobi at the time and even caused many deaths. My husband Hotarubi and I\Nwho survived the training… thought to seal the star to prevent\Nany more victims due to the training. A Tracking Unit immediately caught up\Nwith us after we had stolen the star. Hold it! Lord Third Hoshikage… Hotarubi…Natsuhi…\NYour thoughts are reasonable… As it happens, I was also wavering. But in the position of Hoshikage,\Nit was difficult to make a decision. I promise to terminate\Nthe star training. But the hard-line faction\Nof the Star Village might at some point\Nresume the training… You two must leave this village! I want you to keep an eye on\Nthe village from the outside. And if it seems that the training\Nwill begin once again… Please stop it with\Nyour power. Lord Hoshikage… For Sumaru… Tell Sumaru that…we died.\NPlease be good to him. Yes, I understand. Upon allowing us to leave the village, the Lord Third Hoshikage completely\Nprohibited the star training. Like us, the Third Hoshikage\Nwas also distressed at the damage from\Nthe star training. Neji was also talking about that. But are the effects from\Nthe star that severe?! Yes. My husband Hotarubi died\Ndue to side effects a while after leaving the village… I might also die at any time\Nfrom the effects. No way… Then let’s go back to\Nthe village! Tell Akahoshi directly to\Nstop the training! Akahoshi is a man who puts\Nthe prosperity of the village ahead of the lives of\Nthe children. As proof of that,\Nhe has taken Sumaru hostage and has demanded that\NI return the star. What?! Then the masked Ninja\Nfrom that time was… Hold it! Farewell! Wh-What?! It was Akahoshi?! What is it, Sumaru’s mom? They’ve… 					Akahoshi has come. Is this the place? Where’s the star being hidden? Hotarubi… Please protect\Nthe star, protect Sumaru… The star is under that rock… But it seems the entrance\Nis sealed… What can we do with\Na boulder like this…? Our only choice is to blow it up\Nlittle by little with Letter Bombs. I won’t let you do that! Wha--?! Didn’t this brat die in\Nthe Valley of Death? I won’t be done in just like that,\Nbelieve it! You guys step back. Then I just have to do it again. Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast! Here we go! You’re mine! I saw that move coming!\NBecome a sacrifice for my beast! What?! Natsuhi… So you were alive too,\Nafter all, huh? Akahoshi, reconsider one more time… If you stop the star training\Nand release the children, I’ll have no more to do\Nwith the village… I don’t think so! The Third Hoshikage was stubborn and never wavered\Nin his opposition. Opposition to those of us\Nwho trained Star Ninja and attempted to bring prosperity\Nto the village… No! As long as I,\Nthe Third Hoshikage, am alive, the resumption of that training\Nwill never be allowed! Return to your posts… That is all. Have you lost your mind… Akahoshi? You’re the one who’s lost his mind! Rest easy and go to\Nthe other world… Our generation will\Nraise this village to rival that of\Nthe Five Great Hidden Villages… Was this…really okay? It was necessary for the sake\Nof the village, right? Exactly! We can do star training\Nas we please. Unforgivable! What do you think of all those\Nwho are training frantically, believing in you guys?! One’s even on the verge of dying!\NDo you understand that?! Sacrifice is unavoidable for\Nthe sake of village prosperity. A Shinobi is merely a tool for that. For the sake of village prosperity? Knock it off! All you’re doing is deceiving\Nthe people in the village! This is a Star Village issue…\NI will settle this. B-But…! Step back! Yotaka, Shisou! Wha--?! He devoured\Nhis comrades’ Chakra! My Chakra beast has a full stomach. Things won’t go as they did before. Talk is cheap! Sumaru’s mom… Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone. In a strange park,\NI play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm. Yellow Moon. Even now, counting to three,\NI open my eyes Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.

She’s stable for now, but her condition can worsen\Nat any moment. What? Her Chakra Network that had\Nalready been weakened due to the side-effects of the star\Nbefore she received Akahoshi’s attack. In other words,\Nher Chakra Network is all beat up? Hey, Granny Tsunade\Ncould heal her, right? I don’t know.

What the heck is happening…? Why does Hinata have\Nto be kidnapped?! Why are there guys who know\Nthat we’re searching for Bikochu?! We were being watched all this time.\NEver since we arrived… You were aware of that?! You’re the only one who didn’t know. Why didn’t you tell me?! Because if we told you,\Nyou’d have raised a big fuss! And the insects would flee!\NAll the insects…! Including the Bikochu! If they tried to steal the Bikochu\Nfrom us through force, the insects would be in danger\Nof getting hurt. So they captured Hinata and\Ndecided to go with a hostage exchange. That’s very smart of them. Something smells sweet… It’s the smell of honey. Bee’s honey… Bees…? Hinata’s scent ends here… In that case… Those guys waited for a moment when\NHinata was alone and attacked her using bees. I’ve heard that in the Hidden Stone Village\Nin the Land of Earth, there’s a clan of insect handlers\Nwho primarily use bees. The name of that clan is…\Nthe Kamizuru Clan. Kamizuru…? That’s a name\Nthat isn’t heard very often. Seems they were once hailed as being\Nat a level equal to the Aburame Clan… But they aren’t anymore? This is a story from\Nthe times of my grandfather… There was a time when the Shinobi\Nof the Hidden Stone Village were going to invade the Leaf Village… The Kamizuru Clan was designated\Nto spearhead the operation… The plan was to create\Na disruption by releasing a large swarm of bees into the village\Nfollowed by an invading main unit… However, the Aburame Clan\Nwised up to that and prepared to engage the enemy\Nin the forest to the west! This battle between insect handlers\Nwhich had no precedent in history… ended in the Aburame’s victory… With this battle as the turning point, the Aburame Clan rose to\Nunchallenged status in the Village Hidden in the Leaves… On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan\Nwas subjected to cold treatment even in their own village. I’ve heard that only a few of them\Nremain now… So those people came here\Nto capture Bikochu, huh? What the heck are those guys\Nplanning to do with the Bikochu? If my insects come back\Nwe might be able to learn something… I see… I've been captured… The Village Hidden in the Leaves is\Nin a difficult situation right now… Because of that incident\Nat the recent Chunin exam? The Hokage was assassinated,\Nand I hear they lost many Shinobi too. Times are about to change dramatically… This is a chance for us,\Nthe Kamizuru Clan, to distinguish ourselves. But to do that… The founder’s Book of Secrets, huh? A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu\Nfor Insect Handlers are apparently inscribed therein\Namong other things… If we possessed that at the time of\Nthe battle with the Aburame Clan, we wouldn’t have lost… However, Clan members have continued\Nto search for it for many years, but couldn’t find it. Do you really think\Nwe can find it after all this time? That’s why we need the Bikochu … I brought the keepsakes\Nof the founder, my grandfather, with me… When the Bikochu emerges,\Nit will pursue the scent it recognizes. And we should be able\Nto locate the Book of Secrets that Grandfather hid just\Nas he was dying. This strand of his hair\Nwill surely lead us to it. If we get our hands on\Nthe Book of Secrets and if we engage in some big action… I am certain that… the people of\Nthe village will also acknowledge us. Those people are also desperately\Nseeking recognition. Naruto… Did you find out anything?\NHow about Hinata’s whereabouts? No… The other insects were probably\Nalso done in by those guys. Damn! Then our only choice\Nis to do what they want? When I went to all that\Ntrouble of finding it… So you want to desert Hinata? H-How could anyone possibly do that?! I won’t desert her no matter\Nwhat might happen! Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash! Exactly. But then we’d be able to locate Sasuke\Nif we have this guy here… Well, I guess we’ll have to think of\Nsome other method of finding Sasuke. Yeah… Right now, the first thing\Nwe need to do is rescue Hinata. But, do you think Hinata\Nwould be satisfied with that? The person who originally\Nthought up this plan was Hinata. Huh? But… It’s true that I told her about\Nthe existence of Bikochu… However… The odds of finding\Na Bikochu are extremely low… We thought that she should aspire\Nto an important mission with an assured outcome for the village,\Nrather than a mission with such low odds. But Hinata didn’t give up. She argued persistently that\Nif there was even a small possibility, one should take on the challenge. Th-That Hinata did…? She was extremely forceful and\NShino and I had no choice but to agree. It’s the first time Hinata\Never volunteered for a mission. For that reason too,\NI want to make this a success. Yeah. But when we don’t know\Nwhere Hinata is, how are we…? There is one place where Hinata\Nwill definitely make an appearance. I see! The place where… …the exchange with\Nthe Bikochu takes place! We will definitely have\Na chance at that time. All right!\NWe will recover Hinata without fail… and we will also protect\Nthe Bikochu to the very end! We brought the Bikochu!\NReturn Hinata! Place the insect cage\Non that rock over there! Hinata! Release Hinata! I must verify it first! What’s…the meaning of this?! Are you trying to make a mockery\Nof our Clan? Of insect handlers?! A goliath beetle…\NYou gotta be kidding! Now, Shino! What?! Parasitic Insects! Heh! Recovery successful! All right! Damn! Naruto! All right, resign yourselves! Your time’s up! What’s this? This one doesn’t smell like Hinata! Huh?! Just as I thought… Beeswax…? There they come! Damn! You jerk! You jerk! Damn! All these things are honey…?! Sorry, Naruto…\NBut these damn bees! There’s no end to them! Do we need to slash them\Nif they’re honey?! You two don’t move from there! Huh? This is the genuine thing!\NAnd furthermore, it contains deadly poison. It appears that genuine ones\Nare mixed in… But they’re indistinguishable\Nfrom each other! Back me up for a little! Wall of Insects Jutsu! A-Awesome… Amazing power for a Genin… As might be expected from\Nthe Aburame Clan…I guess. The Kamizuru Clan… Huh…? So you were aware\Nof that fact. Return Hinata! Of course, our intention was\Nto return her… But only if you calmly hand over\Nthe Bikochu. However… It looks like you have\Nno intention of doing that! In that case,\Nwhat do you plan on doing? If you’re an insect handler, you wouldn’t bring a delicate insect\Nlike the Bikochu to a dangerous place\Nlike a battleground… We’ll finish you off right here… and take our time afterwards\Nto search for the Bikochu! Wall of Insects Jutsu! That one doesn’t have\Nany other tricks, huh! Shino! Paper Bombs! Take this! 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu! Insect Clones…? Up to your annoying tricks, huh… Shino! What are we gonna do now?! Don’t you think we should\Ngo back there for a moment? Those guys\Nmight find the Bikochu! No…that location will definitely be safe. More importantly, the first thing\Nwe need to do is search for Hinata! There’s no mistake. Inside here. Hinata! Where are you?! Hey! Be careful! There’s no sign of those guys,\Nbut it might be a trap… Is she there?! Hinata…? Hinata! Are you all right, Hinata? I’ll rescue you in a moment! Just a little more! All right… I got it off! Naruto… Thank you! H-Hinata…?! H-Hinata…stop that! What do you think you’re doing,\Nout of the blue like that?! Who…are you? What are you talking about, Shino?\NThat’s Hinata. If you’re really Hinata, you’d get red in the face\Nand faint if you hugged Naruto. – Huh? 					– Oh! I see… But Akamaru’s nose wouldn’t fail… What? The smell of two people\Nis mingled? You’re not Hinata? Naruto… It’s me…\NI’m Hinata, believe me. In that case… show us what you tried to stick\Non Naruto’s back right now! A Paper Bomb? So you were intending\Nto blow up Naruto! I thought that would work… You are… I see, the one on the hill\Nwas a clone, huh… Wearing Hinata’s clothes… That’s how she was able\Nto compromise the smell. Where is the real Hinata?! I wonder where she could be? I see… Suzumebachi lured\Nthe Aburame Clan, huh? Well, it appears that your comrades… place more value on the Bikochu\Nthan on you. There’s nobody else coming\Nto rescue you. Jibachi, Let’s search for\Nthe Bikochu that those guys hid! There’s not much time until sunrise! Right! Don’t even try to escape. If you make even the smallest movement\Nout of the ordinary, those bees will cut the string. Up ahead is the entrance to\Na labyrinthine underground water vein… If you fall in, you’ll pass into\Nthe other world in an instant. We don’t wish to kill\Nanyone unnecessarily. If you want to live,\NI suggest you just stay quiet. How mortifying… I ended up being\Na burden to everyone, after all. You guys are just like summer insects\Nwho fly right into the fire! If you’re lucky, we’ll meet again… That place isn’t just an ordinary cave. Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto! There’s nothing else to grab on to. Be patient until I’ve checked\Nthe surroundings! No! A huge number of bee larvae! Bee larvae, huh…? But what’s with their unusual huge size? If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu,\NI’ll spare your life. I refuse! Searching for the Bikochu is\Nthe mission that we were given! Then die! Paper Bombs! Damn! Let’s go, Akamaru! Fang Over Fang! That sound is… I see… They’re still continuing to fight\Nwithout giving up. This is not the time to be crying… There’s no way that I can give up.\NI suggested this whole thing! Byakugan! There are 13 bees…\Nattached to the string. If I can take them all down at once…\NI’ll be saved. But, to take down bees that small… Impossible! This guy… I told you before…\NI don't know…when to give up. Naruto… Yes… I won’t give up either! I need to concentrate and\Ncontrol my Chakra… Fang Over Fang! How many of them are there…?! Kiba! I-I can’t muster any strength…\NSomehow my body is… No way! The larvae in this hive’s favorite food\Nis Chakra! What?! As long as you’re in there, they’ll go through the wall\Nto suck up the Chakra… What’s the matter…? So have you decided\Nto tell me the location? Now! Four… Five, six…ten… Eleven, twelve, thirteen… Damn! Summoning Jutsu! Would you like to be the feed\Nfor the larvae… or would you like to get out of here\Nand become the prey of this girl here? Choose whichever you like! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?

You’re a truly frightening,\Ninhuman monster! So, he did it, huh…? The reason I couldn’t select you\Nto be the Fourth Hokage… is because of that distorted\Nconsciousness. I’ve finally been found out, eh…? It’s too bad. Orochimaru…\NWhat’s the meaning of this?! Here I’d set that\Nmany booby traps… so I was quite surprised. But I see… So it was you. Recently, there has been a steady stream\Nof people going missing from the village, from Genin to Chunin,\Nand even Anbu Black Ops members. There was also information that\Nyou had been acting strange… Master Orochimaru… Why did a Shinobi of your rank\Ndo such a thing? Shall I kill you, too? Orochimaru! Sure enough,\Nthis was your doing…? Say it! What were you doing here?! Alas! I’ve been found out. There’s no point in acting cute… It’s for Jutsu development! Orochi… You! For that purpose, you did this\Nto fellow Shinobi…?! As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh… What is it that you want? I want everything! Everything, you say?! Get every Jutsu and understand\Nall of the truths of this world! The one who first mixed\Nblue and yellow named the new color made\Nin that way, green. I just want to do the same thing. If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign… and green is a Jutsu. In the same way that there\Nare no limits to the kinds of colors, there are probably also tens\Nof thousands of Jutsu in this world… But in order to get any\Nand all of the Jutsu… as well as the truths,\Na long time is necessary. It’s the one who takes those\Nlong years to know everything, who can suitably be called\Nthe ultimate individual. For me, the life span of\Nthe body is too short. Too fleeting. Even if I were to be called the Hokage,\Nif I die, it all ends there. Orochimaru… Could it be that\Nthe Jutsu you’re testing here is… Right… It sure could be… Immortality Jutsu! Immortality Jutsu is a technique of eternally pooling one’s own\Nspirits into this earth… In other words,\Nit’s a Revival Jutsu where… you find a new body, put your own spirit\Ninto that body and take it over. I assumed my old form until now, so that you would feel nostalgic\Nabout our reunion… Aging is an empty thing, isn’t it? I feel that keenly when I look at you. You’ll die here… and I’ll get a younger,\Nmore beautiful and stronger body… The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun… I get it…\NYou want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?! Right… Exactly… Sasuke. A Reviving Jutsu where\Nsomeone else’s body is stolen and the spirit is immortalized, huh? How many faces and bodies\Nhave you gone through?! Two, I think… I plan to take Sasuke over after\Nraising him a little more to my liking. But after all, in order to make you regret\Nyour very own life… and curse destiny as you die… …perhaps this face is better? You monster! Lord Hokage! Don’t lower your guard, Sensei!\NYou’re always too soft… What’s been wrong with you?\NThis isn’t like you! I’m sorry… Eyes… Eyes with malice and ambition\Nconcealed in them… I had noticed that\Nyou had such tendencies. I had noticed,\Nbut pretended not to know. It was still during the war-torn era.

Oh really… Yes, my… Please don’t… say anything unnecessary! It appears that Naruto\Nis no longer close by. Hey… Naruto, surely he’s safe, isn’t he…? He can’t be beaten that easily. After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi… Shiragiku Inn\N		 I’m responsible for guarding\N		the ships collecting funds. I’m Hitode. I know the circumstances, your colleague has disappeared\Nand I’m sure that you’re worried… Have you received\Nany information since then? I’m sorry, but there’s been\Nno information regarding a victim rescued\Nfrom a shipwreck. I see. However, I'm troubled. This is difficult to say, but the departure of the collection ships\Nhas been pushed forward… Pushed forward? Now we’re scheduled to\Nleave tomorrow morning. We apologize for\Nour late notice. As expected,\Na large number of people find the relationship with\NLand of Water very important and we had to push\Nthe departure forward. I understand. But we’d like to take time here to seek and investigate\Nour colleague… Of course. We’ll meet you directly\Nat the port tomorrow for the guard duty. Thank you for cooperating. Just one thing. Yes… As you can see, we are\Nnot a very wealthy country. Fishermen and we are\Nboth concerned about the disturbance of\Nthis Demon of the Ocean. We greatly appreciate for\Nyour help with our country. I understand. That’s right, I… You’ve come to? Y-Yeah… Hey, you’re the girl\Nfrom yesterday…! I get it now! You saved me, thank you! It just happened… No, seriously you saved me. Oh, I’m Naruto Uzumaki.\NWhat’s your name? Isaribi. So Isaribi, you’re the girl\Nwho saved my life. Why did you come to\Nthis remote area? A mission, of course! To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean\Nthat has been troubling this country! It would be best to quit. You won't get away easily if you get\Ninvolved with the Demon of the Ocean. You don't need to worry.\NAnyway, this is a mission. We were careless yesterday, but next time we’ll catch that\NDemon of the Ocean--! That’s hot! So…you feel fine now? Yep! Thanks to you,\Nit’s excellent, believe it! Then, once you’ve eaten that,\Nget out. Huh? What? What? Wait, Isaribi! Hey! Isaribi… Wait… Huh, wha--? Monster! Go away! What’s this? It’s the work of some brats\Nfrom the village. If I let it bother me,\Nthere’s no end to it. Oh, Isaribi… Really, thank you so much. She’s out, the monster! What the…? Get out of here! You’re bad luck Take this! I-Isaribi… Stop it, brats! – Disappear!\N– Get out of here! Say something! Hey, stop! All of you! You’re taking your pranks\Na little too far! Who are you?!\NA friend of this monster?! Monster? Everyone’s saying it. Isaribi was spirited away and became friends with\Nthe Demon of the Ocean! Don’t say such irresponsible things! It’s true! Ouch! – Run! 					– Stupid guy! – Hey! Who you calling stupid?!\N– Stop! What?! But… It’s okay… Leave me alone. I can’t leave you alone! If they keep doing that… I’m saying that it’s none\Nof your business! I’m the girl who was\Nspirited away. So it’s natural that people\Nfind me creepy. But that’s not your fault! That doesn’t matter. Humans don’t let those who\Nare different from them into their group. So… Your colleague was lost at sea… We thought that if a boat left port\Nbetween the evening and morning maybe they saw something… Sorry, but I don’t think\NI can help. Because of\Nthe Demon of the Ocean, people of this village stay away\Nfrom the port at those times. I see. He’s been spirited away. That Demon of the Ocean\Ntook someone away again. Mother, don’t say such reckless things. Spirited away… I heard that at the port, too. Can you give me details about\Nthis spiriting away? What good will talking\Nabout it do? But… Please forgive me. This isn’t something to be\Ntalked about with outsiders. Can we do something\Nabout that, please? We came here to exterminate\Nthe Demon of the Ocean. Exterminate the Demon\Nof the Ocean? I see… For a long time, there’s been a legend among\Nfishermen on Demon Island. A legend? Yes, the legend says\Ndon’t come near Demon Island, “the island where demons live.” Demon Island has always been\Na fishing area rich in fish, but there were many hidden reefs\Nand it was a dangerous marine area… So everybody obeyed the legend. But one unusually cool summer\Nabout ten years ago, the fish disappeared from the sea… We couldn’t help it, so my husband and I set our feet\Ninto the dangerous marine area. It was a large catch. But when I happily came\Nto the surface of the ocean, I saw an empty boat with\Nmy husband nowhere to be seen. Ever since then, one after the next, anyone who approaches\Nthat island disappeared. Also, people who went\Nto search didn’t return. Since then people from the village\Nstay away from the island where spiriting away occurs. An island nobody goes near… That’s a peculiar story. Speaking of which, I heard that there’s a girl who returned\Nfrom being spirited away. Oh, yes… Isaribi. Ma’am, I’ve got another favor. Please tell me where she lives! Lady Tsunade… Lady Tsunade! Yes? Geez. Here’s the data you requested. That’s the Land of Sea’s… You’re worried, after all. Hm… Well, yes… The Land of Sea is where Anko,\Nabandoned by Orochimaru, was found… Hey! Are you okay! It’s no good… I can’t remember. Even though I should know… It’s dark and cold… I was in pain… But… Calm down…\NTry taking a little more time. I’m sure I even got this strange mark\Nwhile there… The suggestion is deep. Her entire memory is most likely all… That’s enough…\NYou’ve had some tough times. It’s okay. Right now, we’ll treat this\NCurse Mark that’s eating away at you… We have to do that first. Lord Hokage… I… In the end, her memory didn’t return… A part of Anko’s memory\Nremains lost even now. So that’s what happened… So, this is the first time Anko’s been\Nto the Land of Sea since that incident? Yes… That’s right. It would be nice if\Nit could be a catalyst for bringing back her memories… What?! Missed each other?! They came here?! Yeah, you should follow\Nthem right away! And, which way did they go? That way! That’s the direction I came! Damn! Everybody wait up! The collection ship is moving. I see, the only girl who returned\Nfrom being spirited away. I thought we should at least go see… She may have some information\Nabout Demon Island! Stop! Oh! That girl! Sensei! I wonder where she intends to go? She’s cautious. Let’s follow without being noticed. Hey, everybody! Oh, c’mon. If I keep going like this, I'll go all the way to\Nlsaribi's house again. That appearance… It can’t be,\Nyou’re the Demon of the Ocean…? What?! I won’t let you escape! Master Orochimaru…\NThis is…? I’m going to teach you\Nsomething special. This is one of the rooms\Nwhere I develop Jutsu… I’d like you to help, too. But…if the village knew about this… It’s not going as smoothly as I hoped. It only needs one more step… Silly, there’s nothing to be afraid of. The really frightening thing is\Nto neglect pursuing the truth. That girl, could she be…? Give it up! You can’t escape! You were the Demon of the Ocean! Hey, everyone! Hey! I finally found you! Naruto, you’re safe… But Naruto, you’re too late. Too late? We caught the Demon of the Ocean!\NLook, this is it. Oh! Oh? Huh, so this is\Nthe Demon of the Ocean?! Isaribi… Huh?! Isaribi… You’re Isaribi, aren’t you?! Naruto! What are you talking about?! Just wait! Isaribi!\Nlsaribi, answer me! Damn it! Wait up, you! Wait, don’t be rough. Explanation must wait. We’re in trouble if\Nwe let her escape here. Who are you?! Give Isaribi back! Like that will happen! She's an important guinea pig. If she's lost, I'm responsible for it. Bastard!

It takes three or four weeks to make the pickled bamboo shoots\Nout of the rare bamboo. What?! First, I boil this\Nand then ferment it slowly. What, I can’t eat it right away?! You need a degree of determination\Nto eat delicious things. Naruto, so this is where you were. Hey, what’s up with you? What’s up, nothing, you jerk… Oww! So you force a strange patient on me and intend to eat ramen\Nby yourself at your leisure? Ouch. That hurts. Back to the Past Jutsu! Oh, what’s he doing there? He’s probing into his memory\Nfrom his subconscious. That reverse hypnosis thing, huh? Right. Have you remembered anything? I see. It seems he’s lost his memory. Lost his memory? Let’s call it a day.\NWe’ll do more tomorrow. It seems he doesn’t remember anything. Not his name or address… If none the doctor’s Jutsu don’t work,\Nthen this is the real deal. Then, doesn’t he have something\Nwe could use to identify him? Nope… This is all he had. What’s this? It’s a dove flute, also called an ocarina. Ocarina? It’s broken, though. Oh, it looks like this will stick. Not having memory could also\Nbe a temporary state of shock… Anyway, you sign this. What’s this? A letter of undertaking. I told you earlier,\Nbut this is a Leaf hospital. Outsiders aren’t allowed. If something were to happen, you will take responsibility\Nfor everything, Naruto. What?! You got a problem? Fine, okay. I sure picked up something troublesome. What’s going on?! That’s in the direction of the hospital! Everyone, it’ll be okay.\NPlease evacuate calmly. Help me! Forgive me… Forgive me. Is there anyone left? Anyone here? Sakura, did you evacuate everyone? I’m checking right now. Hey, Sakura! Naruto. Everything okay? Somehow. Hey, where is that guy? What? Come to think of it… He’s not here. Please help! My baby is…\NMy baby is still inside! What did you say?! No way. It doesn’t look like\Nwe can get in with these flames… What’re you doing?!\NHurry up and put out the fire! I’ll go in! That’s reckless. The baby is in the deepest part\Nof the hospital. What? It’s the sound of a flute. It's him! He’s getting closer. Here he comes! Shadow Clone Jutsu! – This way! 					– To the right. He did it! The baby is with him, too! All right! My boy! That was a close shave. Thank goodness! Thank you very much…Thank you! Sure. Thank you so much. An outsider with amnesia, huh? Good grief. What a dilemma. It’d be okay just to let\Nthat one guy stay, right? We can’t do that. For the safety of the village, we must not overlook even\Nthe slightest thing. But, we figured out that he’s not a bad guy\Nafter that incident, right? Unfortunately, we must not let someone\Nwhose identity we don’t know stay in the village. Then, if he were to do something, I’ll take the responsibility\Nand figure something out. Sakura, how’s he doing?\NHas he remembered anything? No, nothing yet. I see. I’m begging you.\NI’ll let you guys have some of the rare pickled bamboo\Nshoot ramen too, Grandma. Rare…pickled bamboo shoots? Yeah. I went to pick some on\Nthe way back from a mission and then found him--! That’s news to me. So you were loitering around like\Nthat on your way back from a mission? Ouch. Oww. Naruto, so you’re serious about\Nlooking after that boy, huh? Yeah, it’s true. All right, then I’ll let that boy\Nremain in the village. Lady Tsunade! I can’t run out the person\Nwho saved a child from this village. Excellent, Grandma.\NNow you’re talking! I’m Naruto Uzumaki…\NNice to know you. I-I’m… Oh, that’s right.\NYour memory hasn’t come back yet. Then, hmmm. Menma, make it Menma. Menma? Yeah. I’d gone to pick some\Nand then I found you, so… Menma… Okay, got it. My name’s Menma. It’s settled. Nice to meet you, Menma. Good to meet you, Naruto. Here you go. Wow, it looks delicious. The ramen here is the best\Nin the world, believe it. Let’s eat. Tasty. But this isn’t the finished product.\NDon’t you notice something lacking? Huh? Oh. Come to think of it, there isn’t\Nany menma pickled bamboo shoots on top. Right. Until the rare pickled\Nbamboo shoots are ready, they’re sealed from your ramen. Hey, old man, you’ll be\Nsure to make it, right? Absolutely. I can’t wait. Say, Menma. Let’s definitely come here together\Nto have some at that time. Right. Okay, come on in. Excuse me for barging in. As of today, this is your home. It’s a dirty place,\Nbut make yourself comfortable. Whoa. It really is dirty. Don’t get so hung up on the details. Y-You’re right. More importantly, let’s get to sleep and starting tomorrow we’ll come up with\Na way to get your memory back. Right. I can’t eat anymore… Man, I slept well! Morning, Naruto. Menma? Whoa. Everything’s been cleaned up nicely! Did you do this? Yeah. I couldn’t sleep and\Nhad time to kill. Thanks for that… Hey, Menma! What’re you doing?! What do you mean?\NI’m hanging up the laundry. Don’t wash someone else’s underwear! I’ll do that myself,\Nso don’t worry about it! Really? Now then…\NHow should we get your memory back? Oh, I know! Come with me, Menma. This is a specialty from the Land of Wind,\NSand Dumplings. This fine soy powder is used to\Nresemble sand and they taste really good. Yeah? And this one is a specialty from\Nthe Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes. The crunchy texture is irresistible. Uh-huh. And this is a specialty from\Nthe Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans. So? Have you remembered anything? No… Nothing at all. Oh, I thought you might\Nremember something if they had a specialty\Nfrom your home. Sorry. No need to apologize. Naruto, forget about my memory. What? You see, we don’t know how\Nor when my memory will come back. More importantly,\Nyou’ve got your own work, right? Well, you’ve got a point. I’ve got to finish cleaning\Nthe Great Stone Faces by today… Then let’s do that. But before that, wait just a minute. Huh? Hey, Menma. Ma’am… I’ll carry your things\Nto your house. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. No problem. At any rate, you’ve sure got\Na lot of weeds growing in your yard. My lower back has been\Nbothering me lately… The grass grows as much as it wants. Then I’ll do it. Oh, my. I-I will, too! Thanks so much! Phew… Finally done! Naruto. What is it? They want help too! Huh? It seems this area here\Nis all homes of the elderly. Thanks. I leave it to you. F-For real? What’s this? Actually, thank-you gifts have\Nbeen sent to Naruto and that boy from all over the village. What’re those two doing? But really, you’re sure an odd guy. Am I? You’ve got a strong\Nsense of righteousness, I mean,\Nyou’re the embodiment of kindness. It’s not something easily done. I just want to live right. I don’t want to have any more regrets. Hm? Menma,\Nhave you remembered something? Huh? No, not really. I see. What?! Is it bird poop? It’s blood! Give me a hand, Menma! Right! What’s the matter?! Someone…in this village… Let’s get out of here! Menma, I leave this guy to you. Got it. Damn it! Damn you. Come on out! Damn it! Where’s he hiding? Naruto… Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?! Huh? What’s this…? Awesome power’s starting to\Nwell up in my whole body. All right. Awesome! Power’s flowing over me! I see you. Damn it. I did it. It’s a Substitution! Damn it. He got away, huh…? You okay, Naruto? Menma… That flute just now… Who in the world are you? The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by As I thought, he’s no ordinary man. He won’t be an easy opponent to fight. Wait a minute. You are talking about Menma\Nlike his our enemy or something. There is that possibility, you know. He could be with the intruder\Nfrom the other day. What are you talking about? Weren't you two gonna help us\Nseek Menma's memory together? Our mission is to find out\Nthe guy's identity and to catch the intruder. Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

An insightful crow comes along\Nto tear up the map Now open your eyes and\Ntake a look at the truth (Yeah!) There's nothing to lose,\Nso let's GO!!! We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high Fighting Dreamers\Ndon't care what people think about them Fighting Dreamers\Nfollow what they believe Oli Oli Oli Oh!\NJust go my way Right here right now (Bang)\NHit it straight like a line drive! Right here right now (Burn)\NWe're gonna do it and do our best! Right here right now (Bang)\NHit it straight like a line drive! Right here right now (Burn)\NWe're gonna do it and do our best! BANG! Okay! Let’s go! Huh? ""Let's go,""\Nwith so much energy… Don't act like a little kid! Oh? You’re in a bad mood. Because! Because!\Nlt's in the middle of my training! There are three steps\Nin the training, right?! I’m only done with the second step! You can do the third step\Neven while walking. What! Really?! A balloon? Here! What’s this…?\NAn ordinary balloon? The first step is “Spin.”\NThe second step is “Power.” And finally, the third step is this. An Impossible Choice:\NThe Pain Within Tsunade's Heart Which one is “this”?! Watch me, it looks as if\NI am simply holding a balloon… You say it “looks as if,”\Nbut nothing is really happening. Then, I will do the same thing\Non my left hand. Let’s see what’s really happening\Ninside the balloon. Wow! The Chakra is randomly spinning\Nand going faster and faster… But still, it’s perfectly round…\Nlt’s almost like… Like a small typhoon, right? What’s happening in your left hand… is happening inside that balloon\Nin your right hand, too? Yeah! That’s right. Cool… The balloon isn’t moving at all\Neven if he’s spinning that much Chakra… There’s more power than\Nthat time the rubber ball popped, and it’s spinning a lot more too! Listen, in this third step, you’ve got to use 100% of\Nwhat you have learned… and retain them. In other words, while keeping\Nthe “Spin” and the “Power” at their max, imagine creating a single layer\Nwithin the balloon and compressing the Chakra within it. Got it! So, this training is about keeping the spin and power that I did\Nin the second step, and conversely,\Ntrying not to pop a delicate balloon! Oh! That’s the most perceptive\Nyou've been so far! Huh? But, what’s the point in going\Nto all the trouble?! In short, it means this. Watch! It’s like this up until\Nthe second step of the training. Next, after you have mastered\Nthe third step! This is what happens! If you can keep this small typhoon\Nthe size of your palm, the force won’t disperse. The spinning gets faster and faster and the power gets\Nmore and more compressed. And the destructive power\Nwill reach its max. Well, so, that’s that. All right! I’ll do this, too! Okay, this feels right… Now! Retain it here! Retain… Retain… No cutting-corners! You’ve got to put out 100% spin and power,\Nand retain them. You gotta be kidding… Unless I can perfectly control all my power,\Nit’s impossible! Now I can see it… This third step… It’s on a totally different level\Ncompared to the others. I told you… With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,\Nit’s a super advanced Ninjutsu. Well, I’m done explaining!\NWe’ll continue as we go on walking. Hey, hey! We don’t need to rush so much,\Nuntil I can properly… We have already wasted enough time\Nwaiting for your body to recover. There’s no guarantee that\NTsunade stays in this town much longer. What?! But, but… It’s not like an old acquaintance\Nis going to conveniently pop up and start talking about\Nthe good old times with her… Come on, let’s go! All right… Long time no see…Orochimaru. I’d looked for you everywhere. What do you want from me\Nafter so long a time? You aren’t thinking of talking\Nabout the old days…? Actually, I need to ask you\Nfor a little favor… His heartbeat is fast… From that complexion,\Nhe must have a high fever. He must have been fatigued\Nfor quite some time… And that arm… Lady Tsunade. You must have understood by now. Go to someone else,\NI don’t treat anyone any more. That won’t do… You must know how serious\Nthis wound is… No one can treat this wound. Except for one of the Legendary “Sannin” who won her fame as\Na medical specialist, Princess Tsunade… You… That arm…\Nit’s not an ordinary wound. A special Sealing Jutsu or something…? What have you done? Well, it just happened…\Nwhen I killed the Third Hokage. You… Really? Humph. Don’t look so scary. Anything that has a form\Nwill one day decay… Same goes for humans. You must already know that too. For you have let two of\Nyour most beloved ones die… Let two of the most beloved ones die? I see… He thinks of terrible things. That was a really terrible way to die… You! Poisoned… She’s fast! Get out of my way! Won’t let you! Calm down, Shizune! This attendant…is an expert. Orochimaru… Your personality's been like this\Nfor a long time. And you know my personality\Nvery well… So stop fooling around with me. I’ll kill you, bastard! She’s powerful… And so scary…\Nshe definitely must be single. Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered… Hey Naruto,\Nthere’s no time to be falling. If we don’t hurry, who knows where that shrew\Nwill disappear again. Hey you, Pervy Sage! That’s no way to speak to\Na hard-working apprentice! Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,\Nnot you. Well, what the heck! To have this Pervy Sage come\Nall the way to meet her… Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be? Hope she’s still here… We didn’t come here to fight. We just want to negotiate with you! Negotiate? Yes. Don’t make me laugh! I’ve already told you once.\NGet out of my sight! We can’t do that. Get out of my sight. You are the only one\Nwho can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arm. Get out of my sight. We’re not asking you to do it for free. Let’s make a deal! I’ll count up to five.\NLeave before I’m done. Or else, I’ll make you disappear myself. Please calm down.\Nlt won’t be a bad deal for you… Five… Four… Three… Two… One… I’ll resurrect the little brother\Nand man, both of whom you loved… with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed. Since we haven’t disappeared yet, I’m guessing that the deal is made? Yes. I do know this young lady… Really? Yeah. To win back the money she lost here,\NI think she said… she was going over there. Spin… Power… Letting them out to their max\Nand retain it… Hey, kid. Hmm? Wanna gamble a bit, too? Over there? Where is that? Hmm? See, if the total number of the pips\Non these dices comes out as even numbers,\Nthat’s “Cho” and if it’s odd, that’s “Han.” Shut up! I am training right now,\Ndon’t bug me! What nonsense!\NThis is a gambling house. Instead of that balloon,\Nlet’s play with these. No way! I don’t have any time\Nto be playing with those dice! Ha, what a boring kid! Shut up! So…can you tell me where that is? Well, you can’t expect things to be free\Nin a gambling house, you know? Okay… Let’s make a deal.\NThe information will be free if you win… And if you lose,\NI’ll give it to you for 1000 ryo. All right! So choose, odd or even! Okay! Here we go… Well, so…\Nsince I am exactly 50 years old. I’ll go for…even! If it’s odd, I win… I’ll open it now. Oh no! 2 and 5, odd! W-What the heck--?! 1000 ryo… Nice, Naruto! Looks like I won… Darn! It didn’t work again! Retain… Where shall I look next? Geez, she’s nowhere to be found! Hm? Me? Lotto? Kids, grownups, everyone loves it. Come and play with\Nthis fun, fun Lotto. There’s one that you know\Nthe result right away. Which one do you want? Really, you are so much cuter\Nbeing chubby! I can’t believe he won\Nwith just one draw. He’s very talented in this… though his talent in Jutsu\Nis still immature. Well…anyhow… Where could have Tsunade gone? She couldn’t have gone that far\Nin this short amount of time. I guess we’ll have to\Nsearch for her from a higher place. If I remember it correctly,\Nthis is a castle town. If we go up to the castle… Naruto! This way! Don’t you want to see those two…\NTsunade? Nawaki…Dan… If I treat your arms,\Nwhat do you intend to do with them? Well, I don’t like to lie… So, I will tell you the truth. Hey, hey! Where is the castle? It’s not there…? In addition to getting what I want… This time, I will completely destroy\Nthe Leaf Village! A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up\Nis the dream we've chosen, right? It's a secondary role, a role in the shadows But in reaching for that dream, let us stay centered,\Nlet us stay true Over and over,\Nwe hung on without giving up Over and over,\Nwe kept coming back up Over and over,\Nwe believed and dreamed Over and over,\Nwe've seen fools Hey, enough already! Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?! Who cares if she is\Nthe legendary Kunoichi?! Who cares if she's\Nthe medical specialist?! There's no way I'll accept\Nthis person as the new Hokage!

48,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. Hey you, failure. I have two pieces\Nof advice for you. First, if you intend to call\Nyourself a Shinobi, stop that revolting cheering of yours. And second... a failure will\Nalways be a failure. There's no changing that! Do you want to see about that? You! Naruto, I get where you're\Ncoming from, believe me. But all fighting must be done\Nofficially in a match! The failure beats the gifted genius\Nthrough sheer effort… Wouldn't that make for\Nan exciting main battle? I promise you. I will win no matter what! Gaara vs. Rock Lee:\NThe Power of Youth Explodes! Hey, Choji! You're in trouble. Only the strong ones are left. Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound\Nmust be that bloke. And Lee is apparently strong\Nenough to take on Sasuke! And particularly that Sand guy! He's probably\Nthe most dangerous one! I-I don't care! I plan to forfeit right away\Nif that happens… So that means… Huh? ...you plan to forego\Nall-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then. What? Come on! Don’t worry. If things start getting ugly, I'll step in and stop the fight,\Nlike I did for Hinata. Okay? Prime beef tongue, short ribs... – You can eat what you want.\N– Don't dangle food in front of him! – Besides he didn't step in...\N– You can eat whatever you want... – and stop the fight for Hinata.\N– and all you want. B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!\NAll you can eat! He doesn't look good. Watching the previous fight… Did it get stirred up? His inner demon! I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too… Here's a plan. Kankuro? Just a little\Ninformation-gathering mission. Hey! Huh? What are you doing here\Nall by yourself? Shouldn't you be with your friends? I-It's none of your business, is it?! Hmmm. Well, well… That guy... Neji Hyuga, right? Well, it seems to me that he didn't reveal the true extent\Nof his power in that last match. What's he about? I'm going to crush him! Err, that's not what\NI was asking. Besides, this guy’s way out of his league... You seem like a fun guy.\NI quite like you. You're dull.\NAnd I don't like you at all! I'm going to waste this guy! We will now resume the battle. Okay! You'll be up this time for sure.\NGo for it, Lee! No! – Huh? 					– What? Seeing as I've come this far,\NI rather be the last! Is Lee sulking? Hurry up and get down here… Safe! – Hey!\N– Don't do anything misleading, idiot! Gaara vs. Rock Lee Oh! Lee! It worked! If you say you want to go last,\Nthen you won't be last. It's an application of the same law that says a stone thrown to hit\Na telephone pole will miss, and a stone thrown to miss\Nwill be a direct hit! Right! That's my student! I absolutely did not\Nwant to go last! I threw them a beauty of a curve! Threw whom a curve? Okay, so let me give you\Na little piece of “nice” advice. Right! Probably no one has noticed yet, but… That gourd is suspicious! I see! Quit with the notes! You're not going to have time to\Nread them during the match! Fool! I see! He didn't realize that? Wow, is Lee going to be all right? All right! 					Go! Lee! Yeah! I am very happy to be squaring\Noff with you so early in the match. I don't know what kind of moves\Nthat bowl-cut guy has, but he will never take Gaara. Never! He's fast, to be sure,\Nbut his kick is not all that great. No… He's... strong! Please don't be in such a hurry. Lee… Be careful, Lee. Now then… The 9th match... Begin! Leaf Hurricane! Is that…? Sand? What an unusual Jutsu… There's sand in his gourd! That's… That's it? Desert Coffin! Desert Burial! Not another horror story like that… A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh? Sounds like trouble. But let's give it a go! Even that Lee’s fast strikes… have no effect at all! What's the deal?! No physical strike is going to\Nhave any effect on him. What? The Sand shields and protects Gaara on its own accord, independently\Nof any intent on Gaara's part. That's why... no one has been able\Nto do it so far.... Injure Gaara, that is. Curses! He's not moving\Na muscle and still...! Is that it? Entertain me a bit more… There's not enough yet! Blood! Why is Lee only using Taijutsu? He'll never be able to get close\Nenough for that! Why doesn't he step back a bit and\Nuse Ninjutsu or something? It’s not that he doesn't use it. He can’t use it. Huh? Lee has almost no Ninjutsu\Nor Genjutsu skills. N-No way! When I first met Lee,\Nhe was completely inept. He had no talent whatsoever. What? I can't believe that! Hey hey! Certainly… A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsu\Nand Genjutsu is a rarity. That’s why, the only path open to Lee\Nas a Ninja was Taijutsu. But! That's precisely what\Nmakes him a winner! Huh? Lee, take them off! B-But Guy Sensei...! You told me only to do that to protect a large group\Nof very important people! That’s quite all right! I give you permission! Are those…? Weights? That's some cliché training… I see! Ridiculous! All right, now I can\Nmove easily! Humph! Does he think\Nremoving some measly little weights is going to enable him to\Noutmaneuver Gaara's sand…? A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy. Go, Lee! Right! Go! Very close! Fast! Amazing…! Because he can't use\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu... Therefore, he channeled all\Nof his time, all of his energy and... all of his being into Taijutsu. Though he can’t do any other Jutsu… He won't lose to anyone… He is a Taijutsu specialist! I can't believe it!\NGaara's been injured! No way...! Bushy-Brows is even\Nfaster than before! Was he this strong?! Youth is... explosion! Right! Over here! Good! I got him good! A-Amazing, he's so fast! The Sand Shield can't keep\Nup with him! A direct hit! A-Amazing. His strikes are lightning fast…! I can't even track him\Nwith my eyes! Uh oh… Uh oh is right! That black-circles-under-the-eye\Nguy is taking some serious blows! That's not what I meant. Huh? W-What the…?! His face is crumbling right off…! His whole body is covered\Nwith sand…. There's not a scratch on him! W-What’s with this guy?! Sure enough, he was\Nencased in sand, eh. But, it's been a long time since I've seen that expression\Non Gaara's face. I felt that he was becoming\Nmore and more unstable as the Chunin Exam progressed… So Gaara's other self has\Nbeen awakened, eh? Hey! What is that? That protected him\Nagainst Bushy-Brow's strikes? Yes… It's Sand Armor. Armor? Ordinarily, the Sand Shield\Nfunctions to protect him automatically, but, if by chance,\Nthe Shield is penetrated, the Sand Armor functions as a second\Nlayer of protection against strikes… That's Gaara's…absolute defense! Well then, there's no way\Nto get him! He doesn't have any weak points. No. That’s not entirely true… The Sand Armor is actually\Nriddled with weak points. First of all, because it's not automatic,\Nit uses up a lot of Chakra. It's also less effective\Nthan the Sand Shield, and it takes an enormous amount\Nof physical energy to keep the sand clinging\Nto the body like that. Gaara's having to use the armor...\Nis proof that he's under pressure. That Lee is really good… But, the outcome of the match\Nis already a given. He will never beat Gaara! Is that all? But what an incredible\Ndefense he has... no amount of speed is going\Nto let me get a strike through. I'll have to do major damage\Nfrom above the sand guard. That will be Lotus! Yes. Be ready! A thin sand guard like that\Nwill be inconsequential in the face of Lee's high-speed\NLotus slamming down from above. Hurry up and bring it on! You asked for it! He didn’t float. Not just yet! What an amazing series of kicks! Even an ordinary Lotus has\Na tremendous strain on the body…! Lee, let this be the finishing blow! Take this! Primary Lotus! I got him... good! Right on! I-It's over! W-What? This can’t be! He did it! Lee’s won! Hey, he isn't dead, is he? Wha--?! Huh?! What?! Hey, can you hear it?

33,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. Where is... this place...? Who is it? Me... 					from long ago? Father and mother didn’t need to die! Everyone was killed. I had no power so... the clan vanished. Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho! Ino... Why? I can’t let you upstage me\Nin front of Sasuke! Squirming again... The Leaf Village worms wandered in. What are the two of you thinking?! They’re bad news! It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped! Ino steps out and\Nwe men should run? Sorry to get you involved. But anyway we’re\Na Three-Man Squad, after all. We’re all in this together, aren’t we? Well, we’ll see. No! I don’t want to die yet! Let go of my scarf! You’re annoying! Quit wiggling! It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso. What did that guy just say? I....didn’t quite catch it. Huh?! That word is taboo to Choji. Try saying it again... I said if you have a problem,\Npull out, fatso. Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned!\NBlast it! Hurraaaay for Big-Boned! W-Wow... All right! You understand this, right?! This is a battle between Leaf and Sound! Lucky! He’s lost it! No way, this looks like it’s going\Nto be a pain in the butt. That’s my line. I was told to get Sasuke\Nby the end of the test... Sasuke... Sakura... The two behind...\Ntake care of them. Okay! Well then, Team Ino,\Nlet’s go full throttle! Right! Formation Ino! – Shika! 					– Cho! I’m counting on you, Choji Okay! Expansion Jutsu! Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu! Human Boulder! What is this Jutsu? Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling? Slicing Sound Wave! You! He jumped?! The air pressure of\NSlicing Sound Wave is less than effective\Nagainst that rotation. Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,\Nif I’m touched by something like that the bones in my arms will be crushed! Think I’ll let you?! You’re the most annoying so... Ninja Art! Shadow Possession Jutsu! My body! Huh?! Dosu?! What are you doing at a time like this?! Shadow Paralysis Jutsu? Ino, next it’s just the ladies. Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body. Gotcha! Huh? Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu! Shoot! Kin! What happened? This... is the end of it. You guys! If you make one move,\N this girl named Kin is dead meat! If you don’t want this\Nto end right here, leave your scroll and walk away! Once you’ve gone far enough that\NI can’t feel your Chakras, I’ll release this girl! These guys...\NWhat are they grinning about? – Choji! 					– Yeah! This isn’t good! They won’t...! Ino! Uggghh. I’m dizzy. W-What kind of person...\Nhurts their own comrades? Careless. Our goal is not the scrolls or\Nto pass this test playing by the rules. What? It’s Sasuke. Humph... My Jutsu... So your much precious\NShadow Paralysis Jutsu is limited to 5 minutes? It’s not Shadow Paralysis.\Nlt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu. In addition, it seems that\Nthis girl’s Jutsu... seems to be a Jutsu to\Ntake over the other’s body. From the looks of the blood\Nshe’s spitting up, if I kill Kin, that girl will die too... Are you going to do in...\Nyour teammate? If I need to... This is no good. Shoot... That’s too bad...\Nyou’re just a step away. You’re too easy-going. Hmph, I don’t like this at all. You minor Sound Ninjas... Bullying the second-rate guys and\Nputting on airs like a winner. What?! They're Lee’s teammates... Lee! You goofed. Hah! Coming out of nowhere\Nlike cockroaches... That kid with the bob lying over there\Nis on our team, but... But you messed with him, didn’t you?!. What’s with his eyes? It’s like they see through everything... If you’re gonna continue,\N I’ll fight with full strength! Huh? What ‘s wrong? Neji... This Chakra... If you don’t like me,\Ndon’t play cool, come down here. No. Evidently, there’s no need for that. After all... without power... I can’t do anything! Because I had no power...\NEveryone was killed! No...\NYou let them be killed. You only... watched. If only I had power... If only I had power... Sasuke! You’re awake...\NHuh?! Huh? That’s... Sasuke? Sakura... Sakura... Who did this to you? Who is it? The Curse Marks run\Naround his entire body?! Sasuke... 					That body...? Don’t worry. On the contrary,\Nstrength is rapidly flowing in... Right now I feel good. That guy gave this to me. Huh? At last I understand... I’m an Avenger... On my road, I must put power\Ninto my hands... even if it means abandoning\Nmyself to the devil. So... I see... So the mark on the neck\Nthat this girl called Sakura spoke of is this Curse Mark. But... I didn’t think he could stand up... Sakura, tell me... Who harmed you...? Me! Huh? Ino! If you stay like that\Nyou’re gonna get involved! Come back to this body! Choji, you too,\Ncome over here and hide. Y-Yeah. Uh-oh. Release! Okay, she’s back! Shikamaru! What’s going to happen now? How should I know? Wha--?! W-What’s this...? No matter... how you look at it.... his Chakras are... too big! Dosu, this half-dead bastard\Nis nothing to be scared of! Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?! I’ll take care of all of them... in one fell swoop! Super Sonic Slicing Wave! Heh! He must have been blown to pieces. – Who did? 					– Huh?! Zaku! He’s fast! Moreover, he took in those two,\Nand in the blink of an eye. Fire Style! Phoenix Flower Jutsu! Don’t push your luck! I’ll blow them off! What?! Shuriken’s in the fire?! Zaku, below you! The quality of the Chakra\N is completely different... Is that really Sasuke? What happened?\NWhat in the world...? It seems like you’re\Nproud of your arms... You! S-Stop it! Sasuke will definitely come for me. You’re the only one left. You... make it a little more fun for me. This isn’t... This isn’t... This is not like... Sasuke! S-Stop!! Stop it. Please... Stop. The Curse Mark is withdrawing... We’re saved for now. Sasuke! You’re strong. Sasuke... We can’t defeat you\Nthe way you are now. This is our fee for settling this... Please let us withdraw from here. Huh? It seems selfish, but we now have\Nsomething we need to confirm, too. That being said,\Nlet’s make a promise. If there’s another opportunity to\Nbattle with you in this test, we won’t run or hide. Wait! Who in the world is Orochimaru? What did he do to Sasuke?! Why Sasuke?! I don’t know... We were just given orders to\Nmake the hit on Sasuke. Though you ordered us to\Nassassinate Sasuke, you got to him first. Moreover, you didn’t kill him,\Nand left that Curse Mark instead. I don’t know what you’re thinking... Hey! Are you okay?! It’s a pain, but Ino,\NI’ll leave Lee to you. Got it. That Chakra...\Nlt’s abnormal. The Uchiha clan...\Nthis good, huh? Sakura’s in danger! It’s okay...\NI’ll protect Sakura. Well, what should we do\Nwith this guy? Kick him awake? Can I do it? What am I...? Sasuke... Hey, can you hear it?

15,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!\Nls it the clones? Where's the real body?! It's useless for you to even attempt\Nfollowing with your eyes. I absolutely will not be caught. Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu! Don't! This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses mirrors that can\Nreflect only my image. Watching you from the speed I move, it almost seems as if\Nyou aren't moving at all… I knew it! Is that Jutsu…\Nthe Kekkei Genkai?! Kekkei…Genkai…? It's the same type as\Nmy Sharingan… Then…! That's right… It's impossible even for me\Nto copy that Jutsu… And there's no way to destroy\Nthat Jutsu, either! Darn it… So… What?! I can't die here yet. 'Cause I have a dream\Nthat I must turn into reality… The dream to have my strength\Nrecognized by everyone in the village… and become the Hokage! Dream… I, for the sake of my dream.\NAnd you, for the sake of your dream. Please don't hold it against me. I want to protect someone\Nspecial to me… I work for the sake of that person,\NI fight for that person, and I want to make that\Nperson's dream a reality… That's my dream. For the sake of that dream\NI will completely become a Shinobi, and kill you guys! Zero Visibility:\NThe Sharingan Shatters Sasuke! Naruto!\NDon't lose to a guy like that! Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him! What? Even if there was a chance that\Nwe could break that technique, they won't be able to defeat that boy. W-What do you mean? They don't have the mentality\Nto kill their feelings… and kill another person! That boy really knows\Nthe agony of being a Shinobi. He's different from Naruto and Sasuke. Exactly… No real Shinobi will come out of\Na peace-addicted village like yours. Because they are not able\Nto learn the most important ""experience of killing""! Then… Then… What are we going to do, Sensei?! If I go over to\NNaruto and Sasuke, Tazuna will be in danger. Even if I try the Shadow Clones. He'll come to stop me with\Nhis Water Clones. I'll just be wasting Chakra. Then... I'm sorry but... I'm going to have to finish\Nthis in an instant. Sharingan?! The Sharingan again? Such an unimaginative guy! Sensei! You might call me ""an unimaginative guy,"" but you are afraid of the Sharingan,\Nafter all... Zabuza! The secret technique of a Shinobi… isn't something that you show\Nyour opponent so many times. Be appreciative. You're the only who has had\Nthe chance to see it twice… And there will be no third time… Even if you were able to defeat me,\Nyou can't defeat Haku… What…? Kakashi Sensei can't win? That boy in the mask is that strong? Since he was a kid, I have been\Npainstakingly teaching him the battle techniques of the Ninja! All of my techniques. On top of that… he has been polishing up\Nhis own skills as well! As a result... He has... no matter how unbelievably difficult\Nhis predicament, been extremely successful. He has no ""heart"" and has\Nabandoned the notion of ""life."" He is a fighting machine\Nknown as a Shinobi. Not only that,\Nhis Jutsu surpasses mine! The terrifying ability of\Nthe Kekkei Genkai. In other words,\NI have acquired a sophisticated tool. Unlike the scrap you're\Ncarrying around. I'm not one to be afraid just\Nbecause I failed once! I'll do it as many times as it takes! The Shadow Clone Jutsu! Stop! W-What the hell is it…?! I-It was just slight but… I could see the trails of his movements… One more try! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Don't you understand that it's useless? Just because I see the trail, doesn't mean that I can keep up\Nwith his speed. The water…\Nis being repelled. But, what if that wasn't water…? All right… The next one is going\Nto be my one shot! Just because a bunch of scrap\Ngot together doesn't mean that\Nthey can defeat Haku. He is….\NHe is the best tool! There's nothing boring than\Na stranger bragging… It's about time…\NI make my move. Now wait.\NAs long as we're talking… Let me brag about another thing… Hmm? In the battle before, I didn't just let you defeat me\Nlike a fool. It's over… Haku, who was hiding in the corner, was observing part of the battle. Haku is quite smart. With his ability to analyze, he is able to plan a counterattack\Nafter observing a technique just once. I've been anxious to copy your line. ""I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu\Nwon't work on me twice."" Was that it…? Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu! Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu! This is...?! What is this…?\NThis really thick fog? The visibility is close to zero... Sensei…! Sakura! Stay with Tazuna! That's right. I have to trust Sasuke,\NNaruto and Kakashi Sensei right now… And I should do what I can do! Huh? Oh! Sakura! Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,\N don't move away from me! Yeah… I soo know it! I know… 					Zabuza… I'll finish them off soon enough… Shadow Clone Jutsu! You just don't learn, do you?! What? The Fire Style Jutsu! It takes…too long! This is good! Bit by bit, I'm figuring out\Nthe timing... I know it's called Hidden Mist,\Nbut the fog is way too thick… Even Zabuza himself shouldn't\Nbe able to see anything... Good job on dodging it… Just what I expect of Kakashi\Nof the Sharingan... He's…. closing his eyes! But…the next time you see me, that'll be the end of it all… You overrate the Sharingan too much. What…? You spoke as if you saw through\Neverything, but… Why? Could it be possible that\Nyou can see the future…?! You are going to die. Your foresight was wrong, after all. Kakashi... You can't read my mind or\Nmy future... The Sharingan is merely a diversion\Nthat makes you believe that! Those who have the Sharingan... possess both\Nperceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes… Using these two powers and\Nbringing out Jutsus one after the other.. you were just acting as if\Nyou can read the future! First with the perceptive eyes,\Nyou copied my movement right away. And this is the Image\NReplication Method. You first got me in\Na ruffle with it… Once you make sure that\NI'm flustered, you nail the ""heart's voice."" – This is the Mind Imitation Method.\N– It's only an imitation, after all. – You can't defeat me! You monkey!\N– You can't defeat me! You monkey! That imitating monkey mouth... I'll make sure that you won't be\Nable to open it any more! And… You judged the right timing when\Nmy frustration was reaching its height W-What is that? You set a clever trap. Me...? You used the Genjutsu with\Nyour hypnotic eye and made me weave the signs first... This is the Jutsu Imitation Method... The Giant Vortex Jutsu! R-Ridiculous! Then that makes it easier. First vanish into the thick fog, and make your\Nperceptive eyes useless…. Huh? Darn! The guard is falling behind! I will close my eyes as well! I will shut off your ability to use\Nyour hypnotic eye in a close-distance battle. Why? That also means that\Nyou will lose your ability to see. Did you forget...? That I am a genius in Silent Killing, a technique to find\Nthe target just by sound. He read my movement...\NNo way could he do that. Darn! We were so close! Naruto, can you still move? Of course! I'm totally fine! He's pretty much spent…\Nand it's no wonder. Shadow Clone Jutsu uses\Na lot of Chakra. But thanks to him,\NI found our way out. I found the way to break through! Hah!  Impossible! That was just a coincidence. Naruto! Run! What? Run out of here and\Nattack from the outside! A-All right! You won't be able to...! I-I'm not going to lose! There! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Darn! T-That was good just now! What? We're doing it one more time! All right! It's likely that there's a limit\Nto that guy's Chakra, too! To prove that,\Nhe's little by little… This won't go as you've planned. First, I'll get you! Sasuke! Darn! It's been a while since\NI've fought in such bad conditions. And I'm worried about\NSasuke and Naruto, too... Be calm… Think...\NWhat will he come after? Oh no! What?! Too late! Why? Why is it? Why did this happen? I never asked for your help!\NI hated you! But you… Darn! I won't forgive you! Next episode:\N ""The Broken Seal""",,,,0.13081878423690796,,0.06417573988437653,0.08404613769380376,0.02292170445434749

I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? I’m exhausted! Important solo mission, my butt! They just didn’t have enough manpower\Nfor the castle restoration. That’s not the job of a Shinobi. Ow-ow… I won’t hold up if\NI don’t rest somewhere. Oh! I’ll take a bath.\NHere I go! Hey…\NI’m sounding like an old man. Wh-What?! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Thank you. Who the heck are you, mister? I’m a Delivery Ninja! Please, Mr. Postman! 23, 24, 25… 26… No mistake… Thanks to you Mister Naruto,\Nall of the postal articles are safe. By the way, what’s a Delivery Ninja? We are postal professionals\Nwho risk our lives to deliver the important parcels\Nour customers have left with us. In other words, you’re a postman. I am a Delivery Ninja! Ordinary postmen don’t risk their lives. So you’re an awesome postman, huh? That’s right. Oops, I must not keep\Nmy customers waiting. Then, I’ll be on my way… Mister! What’s your name?! I’m 596-03. A zip code…?! Anywhere would be fine\Nif I can get in a hot spring… Cripes…\NHere it’s still day time and… That voice… My, you’re a strange one, Jira-chan. Am I? Ah, Pervy Sage! What?! Who’s a Pervy Sage…?! What’s the meaning of this,\NPervy Sage?! Hadn’t you left the village\Non an important mission? That’s why I was being patient\Nabout you training with me! If you’ve got the free time to be\Ndoing something like this, help out with my training right now! W-Wait, Naruto.\NThere’s a reason for this… You probably have some glib lies\Nabout gathering information or something. You’re wrong, you’re wrong.\Nlt’s data collection, data collection… You see… It’s my final spurt for the manuscript of the final volume\Nof “Make-Out Violence.” What about the mission…? Well, you see, I’m on a mission. So don’t worry… What kind of mission? As it happens, I received information\Nthat a member of the Akatsuki Organization will be visiting this town\Nthe day after tomorrow. The Akatsuki Organization!\NThen, that Itachi will be…? I don’t know that.\NAnd the same goes for their purpose… But that’s a matter until\Nthe day after tomorrow. And so, I’m making effective use\Nof the free time! Then it’s perfect.\NGive me some training! Well… you see, they’re so insistent\Nabout the manuscript. I ended up promising the publisher\Nthat I’d send it today or tomorrow. Come on! It’s a long-awaited chance\Nfor training. If my manuscript were\Nto be completed early, I might be able to take\Nsome time for training. Oh, my shoulders are stiff! There, there. Oh, I’m thirsty! Here you go. Hot! Hey, the ideas I just about had\Nhave blown away! Enough! I’m taking a bath! What a hard Sensei to please… I bet he’s going to say\Nthis is data collection, anyway. We must deliver that secret document to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs,\Nno matter what the cost… It seems this is where\Nthe Delivery Ninjas always stay. Oh, they could… Delivery Ninja? I can see them now. This is all I need for\Nmy writing desire to well up… I’m not getting…inspired with this… Imagining with your head\Nis a writer’s job, isn’t it? I’m a writer rooted in realism!\NGetting a picture is important. So I wonder if you’d do that for me. Can you write if I do that? I’ll write, I’ll write!

Ow-ow-ow… Oh, the sealed documents… Please take extra care with this. I will take it for you. Ow-ow-ow… Excuse me, can I also ask you\Nto take this for me? Oh! Mister Naruto.\NThank you for helping me out yesterday. Oh! Mister! I am 596-03. It’s hard to remember! More importantly, I want to ask you\Nto take care of this! Hmm…This goes in a different direction… Have a heart. Please. Oh, perfect timing. Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone? He is 463-72. This area should be in your jurisdiction. It is. Then I leave it to you…\NWhat was it again? I am 463-72. Hurry, okay? Wake up… Whoa! I fell asleep! Pervy Sage, let’s start training! What’re you talking about?\NI must complete the manuscript… You don’t need to worry\Nabout that. I wrote the manuscript and\Nsent it to the publisher! So now you can devote\Nyourself freely to training… Right, Pervy Sage? You idiot! Huh? If something like this were read,\Nit’ll be the end of my writing career! Ah… Oh… I’m sorry. You said you sent it to\Nthe publisher, right? How? I gave it to a Delivery Ninja\Nin the inn… D-Delivery Ninjas. You mean, the one that delivers any\Nparcel to the addressee, no matter what… not influenced by any land or institution…\Nthat iron organization?! After him, Naruto. We’ll chase down the Delivery Ninja,\Nno matter what… and retrieve your manuscript\Nat any cost! If he’s going to the publisher,\Nhe should definitely take this path. Now what’s left is how to\Nclose the time gap… I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas\Nis extraordinary, though… Pervy Sage! Slow down the pace a little, man. Naruto! This is also training! To be straight, you’re short on leg power! A Ninja must apply oneself, connecting this with training,\Nno matter what the situation! Excellent, Pervy Sage.\NNow you’re talking! It’s just like a maze! We’re totally lost… If we had Hinata’s or Neji’s Byakugan\Nat a time like this… Byakugan! I didn’t think of that! That’s the Rasengan, isn’t it?! I’m sorry! Uh, no, you see…! This isn’t the time to be drooling! There he is! After him, Naruto. R-Right! Thieves! Hey, wait! There’s no fool who’d wait\Nafter being told to wait! As it happens, the parcel this person here\Nleft with you this morning is a slip-up! That’s right! I have no knowledge of that. The rule for us Delivery Ninjas is to deliver parcels once left\Nwith us to the destination, even if we have to risk our lives! My life as a writer is also at risk! Don’t look at me. This is trouble! Sorry. To do that to someone\Nwho’s doing honest work… Shut up! When you get right down to it,\Nit was you who… Huh?! What’s this?! This isn’t the thing you wrote! Oh! That time! It got switched with\Nmy manuscript! Say what?! This is…a secret document directed to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs\Nfrom the Land of Claws… Let me see…\NAccording to the information I’ve gotten, the Fang and the Claw could go\Nto war at any moment… This is a secret document for peace! They’ve decided on peace?!\Nlt’s written here. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?!\NWar is no good! You! You idiot! The fact that\Nthis secret document is here means the manuscript you wrote is being taken\Nto the Land of Fangs! What’ll happen if they read it as\Na secret document from the Land of Claws? This is bad! No doubt, war will begin! We’re going to the Land of Fangs! R-Right! This time for sure we’ll take back\Nthe manuscript! Postal thieves…\Nmy customer’s important parcel…! This is bad! This is 463-72. This is 463-72! A postal robbery has occurred! The thieves are a pair, a large man with a perverted look\Nand a kid! ""They appear to be after 596-03’s parcel."" ""Members in the area are assigned\Nto protect 596-03!"" ""Stop the thieves in the name\Nof the Delivery Ninja!"" The only way to get to the Land of Fangs\Nis to go up this river. More than likely they will also go\Nby boat. Then depending on our speed,\Nthere’s a chance we’ll catch up. I’m the one who’s got it rough. You don’t have enough physical strength! Consider this also as training\Nand apply yourself! That again?! Who’re those guys?! It appears reinforcements\Nhave been summoned. Hurry, Naruto! Naruto! Switch places! Rasengan! Rasengan! Somehow…the Rasengan looks like\Na really cheap Jutsu… It’s for the sake of preventing a war! Our mission of peace is at stake! – Right! 					– Switch. Huh? Shadow Clone Jutsu! Rasengan! Rasengan! Rasengan! That’s it! Hey, wait! It’s a slip-up!\NThis is the real one! They got switched during the commission! Delivery Ninja old man,\Nit’s the truth! I’m sorry. According to our rule,\Nwe are never to look inside a customer’s parcel we have taken on,\Nno matter what. If that passes over to the Land of Fangs, there will be war! Even if that were the case,\NI must not break the rule. You’re impossible! It’s the Land of Fangs! All we do is carry out our duties! Then…we’ll take it away\Nby force if we have to. – Postal delivery!\N– Postal delivery! Naruto! Do you know which one it is?! No, I don’t! I am 596-03. I know! It’s 596-03! Where is he?! Up there!

It’s a manuscript of the latest issue\Nof the Make-Out series! That Land of Claws feudal lord…! To think he’d know I was a big fan\Nof the Make-Out series! Everyone! Stop the fighting! Send a messenger to\Nthe Land of Claws! Don’t let anybody in… I kind of don’t really get it, but…\Nwith this, there’ll be no war? No war is fine… But does this mean my writing power\Nis the same as Naruto’s scribbling…?! Now then! Today’s the day the Akatsuki Organization\Nguy comes! We’ll capture him no matter what\Nand get information about Sasuke… Pervy Sage? Sorry, Naruto. There was a development\Nwhile you were sleeping. I will pursue\Nthe Akatsuki Organization as is. I’ve been had! Well… I suppose it made for\Nsome good training… The wind blows, Ah… The pain,\NThe memories won’t disappear What should be brought along? Assemble them into a piece. There is no second chance, never How foolish it is to throw away Acting so innocently, Ah… The images.

As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain All right, thanks for waiting! ""The Special Presentation Today!"" ""The Top 5 Famous\NSweat and Tears Ninja Battles! ""There Are Also Fun Extras""\Nhas finally started! Isn't this exciting, Sakura?! Yes, from the next episode, “Naruto” which you’ve all\Nbeen supporting for the past four years\Nwill enter its fifth year. And so today,\Nwe’re changing our plans to present you with\Nfamous battle scenes in the order determined by\Nvotes from the guys in the Leaf! Is that favorite battle you want\Nto see again included? We’ve also invited\Nsome special guests, so don’t miss it! Then, we’ll be moving on ahead. First, check out fifth and\Nfourth place back to back! FIFTH PLACE\NNARUTO VS. SASUKE\N		~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~ All right, here we go,\Nhere we go, here we go! Just what you’d expect of me,\Nthe hero! To think I’d appear right at the start. I’ve shrewdly got everyone’s hearts! You’re right! To be honest, the coolness of Sasuke in motion\Nis unfathomable. Outstanding destructive power.\NCha! Umm, Sakura? Our comments aren’t meshing\Nright off the bat. Just keep quiet! Right. Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Attack and defense with\Nno time to breathe. This is gripping. Throw in a kick there! Give him a beat down and thrash up! Umm, Sakura. How about\Na little support for the hero there…? Shut up, Naruto! Naruto Barrage! Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu! Wh-What’s that Jutsu?! You jerk! Chidori! Stop it…you two… Stop it! That’s mean to punch me all\Nof a sudden, Sakura! I couldn’t help it.\NI got excited. FOURTH PLACE\NCHOJI VS. JIROBO\N		~FATSO VS. FATSO~\N		Now, let’s collect ourselves\N		and check out fourth place next! It’s too late whatever you do now! Crushing Palm! Man, this battle moves me to tears,\Nno matter how often I watch it. That’s right! As it happens, I sat down on my knees in front of\Nthe TV while blowing my nose. It invoked tears in the living rooms\Nin the Land of Fire for sure. Yeah, yeah… I really thought\NChoji had died in this episode. That’s for sure. I was also totally fooled\Nby the producers. Wh-What’s that…? But… Boulder Blow! It’s futile! I’m a hundred times stronger\Nthan before! They say a grudge over food\Nis ferocious, right? That one punch just now was the grudge for you eating\Nthe last bite of the snack. No way! He’s got so much Chakra\Nhis build has changed! And this is… This is for insulting me by calling me\Na sacrificial piece and fat! But what’s most unforgivable is\Nyou insulting my best friend! That’s more unforgivable than\Nswiping the last bite of gourmet food or insulting me by calling me fat! All my Chakra…\Nto my left hand! O-Oh, no…! This one punch is heavier than life! W-Wait…! 					Don’t be hasty…! But seeing it again,\Nvisually it’s just fatso versus fatso. No appealing parts at all\Nand the screen is stifling. I mean, no way would I want\Nto see this during the summer Excuse me for being stifling. Yikes! Choji. How long were you there…? I heard my famous battle made it\Ninto the top five, you see… Oh wait, Choji. – You’ll understand once I tell you!\N– Calm down! Human Boulder!\N97.01	01:57:15:03	01:57:16:07	I won! I actually…won! We had a bit of an incident here, but let’s not worry about that\Nand move on. Now before we present\Nthird to first place, we’ll show the famous battles\Nleft out of the top five. Is the famous battle\Nyou chose included? Now then, here we go! EXTRA SEGMENT\NUNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA\N~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~ – Rooster! 					– Rooster! – Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!\N– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu! Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei’s\NSharingan is super unfair! Just what you’d expect from a Jonin. KAKASHI VS. GAI\N~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~ – What?! 					– You’re late! – This is a famous battle?!\N– You’re seventeen minutes – Well, it’s cool to have stuff like this\N– and thirty two seconds late! – included once in a while, right?\N– Let’s forget about today… We both have forty eight wins! One of us will move ahead\Nwith this battle! It seems it won’t work\Neven if I say no… This time it’s my turn to determine\Nthe battle category… What will it be?\NA Taijutsu fight? A 100-meter dash? Skin diving? I wouldn’t mind\Nan eating contest… Listen, you… Well then… Wh-What?! Rock-paper-scissors! I accept the challenge.\NNo way will I lose! If I lose, I’ll do five hundred laps around the Leaf Village\Nstanding on my head! Absurdity again… It’s a promise! Here we go again…\NHis favorite own rules. Okay, everyone together now. – Rock-paper… 					– Rock-paper… Scissors! After the commercial,\Nwe’ll present third to first place. Don’t miss it. Now at last for the presentation\Nof third to first place. First up is third place! Now then, which battle has worked\Nits way up to the higher ranks? Here we go! The appearance of\Nthe famous team of Kiba and Akamaru! – Heh! 					– Damn it… – It’s the appearance of\N– Is it all over…? a team that’s just loud. What?!\NYou’re saying to do that?! No, Akamaru! It’s too dangerous to do that\Nwithout any comrades around! You understand that, don’t you?! We’ll die like dogs here if we miss… Ow! Akamaru… To think I’d get bitten by you.\NI’m a pathetic owner… Okay, Akamaru…\NAs you say, we just have to do that… Wolf Fang Over Fang! Now, Akamaru! What?! Show him the fruits of our training! Dynamic Marking! That’s a dirty trick! Now we’re ready! Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast\NTransformation Combo! Two-Headed Wolf! Eat this! Sakon, what’re you doing! To the right! Uh oh…! Wolf Fang Over Fang! Though he sometimes bites\Nhis owner’s hand, he presses for a decision. It seems Akamaru’s stock shot up\Nin the Leaf after this. What a man! Man, my butt! Just a puppy\Nwhose evil eyes got worse! Who has evil eyes?! Yikes, Kiba! H-How long were you there…? Knock it off! Here I was invited as a guest with my battle\Nhaving been ranked high. What’s the deal of\Nfinishing in third place on top of being told mean things?! It’s Kiba and Akamaru\Nwho finished in third. Please face the camera and say a few words to everyone\Nin their living rooms. Oh, umm, thanks for your support. Well, we came in third this time. But we’ll kick the butts of some enemies, so please look forward\Nto our success! Considering you’re talking\Nall big or whatever, didn’t you have a rough time\Nwith it after this? The best is yet to come,\NI tell you! That’s the last straw.\NGet him, Akamaru! Now for the presentation\Nof second place. He’s like a completely different person… His Chakra activity is overwhelming… And those markings… The movements earlier… He dodged the attack from behind and saw me hiding in the shadows… In other words, he’s combining\Nwide vision and x-ray vision. And in addition, that Jutsu… Then… Summoning Jutsu! I’ll find a perfect…\Nway to attack that power of yours. If he defends physical attacks\Nwith rotation and a large emission of Chakra… then I should stop that Chakra rotation! – This is the second place battle?\N– Scatter! That’s right! It’s a battle of brains while\Nassessing the opponent’s weak point! Hmm. But as for me… I’m not a big fan of sluggish battles! – Oh, why? 					– Hmm. How can I put it?\Nlf you’re talking about battle I want to see a collision of fist\Non fist, and body on body. Oh, but a Ninja isn’t just\Nabout Taijutsu. Oh. That’s being rude to Bushy Brow. Oh, sorry. I mean, yeah, I want to see something fiery, like Bushy Brow! There just isn’t anything fiery\Nin Neji’s battles. Here! He’s argumentative or something. Unexciting or something. I’d like him to just take on the enemy\Nwithout regard to appearances! Heh! Missions with you are\Na chore because you think like that. Yikes, Neji! Now then, a few words from\Nthe second place Neji. Humph! How silly. You’re free to evaluate my battles,\Nbut it’s unthinkable for me to be forced to appear\Nin a place like this. Heh! You’re sure making\Nan exhibition of yourself, considering! Oh! Could it be you’re after\Nan appearance fee?! Too bad. This is a program for everyone\Nin their living rooms, so we asked you to do this for free! No problem.\NI asked the Fifth Hokage and she’s treating this appearance\Nas a mission. Since it’s a mission,\NI have no choice but to appear. And of course, a mission fee\Nwill be incurred. Whoa, always the realist. Neji, it’s not fair that\Nyou get paid for this! My brain is built differently than yours! Gentle Fist! It seems the ranking board is busted, so we’ll go right on ahead\Nand present first place. Which battle has finished in first? Chidori! Oh ho! Sure enough, it’s pointless if the number one battle\Nisn’t one of my battles! That’s right!\NThis is the battle that anyone would\Nacknowledge as number one. Rasengan! – Rasengan! 					– Chidori! And so, did you all guess right? The glorious best battle has been\Ndetermined to be “Sasuke’s Battle!” Hey, hey, Sakura.\Nlt’s the “Battle in the Final Valley”! FIRST PLACE\NNARUTO VS. SASUKE\N		~FINAL VALLEY~\N		What? Was it? Forget it. Well, let’s collect ourselves\Nand check out some special footage of myself,\Nwho came in a glorious first place! Y-You…idiot! Hold it!\NWhat’s up with this recording?! – This is different from what I prepared!\N– What’re you doing?! – No, no, don’t watch!\N– Don’t be peeping! I demand a do-over as the hero! Someone not involved is\Nmaking a ruckus. And now, thanks for waiting! Now for the appearance of\Na special guest. Let’s go live to the site.\NMaster Jiraiya! What? What? Master Jiraiya, can you hear me? Yes… Loud and clear. What? Master Jiraiya,\Nwhere are you right now? Mm, I’m in kind of a dubious place. I hope you’ll excuse me from\Ndivulging my location. Well, if I have to say something, I’d say I’m in a certain person’s\Nhideout, I guess. Hey! Pervy Sage!\NWhat’re you doing there?! What happened to you\Nwatching my training?! Now, now.\NToday’s a special program, so don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud. More importantly,\NI’ve met up with someone special… None other than Orochimaru. What?! Sakura…\NWhat the hell is this…?! It sure has been a long time,\NOrochimaru! Oh, same here… Here you could have invited me\Nto the studio. Who would invite the likes of you?! Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu\Nand conducting experiments. And more importantly,\NI need him to get stronger quickly, so. – If he’s there, bring him out!\N– What…?! Actually, I tried talking him into it\Nmany times saying today’s special… But in the end,\Nhe didn’t give me a good answer. – I see… 					– Hey. What?! Are you going to go\Non and on forever? If you’ve got that kind of time,\Nthen continue the training, Orochimaru. S-Sasuke… Sasuke…\Nls that you, Sasuke?! I’ll be going on ahead to the dojo.\NGet a move on. Oh, wait…! Oh, it seems I’ve angered Sasuke. I shall also be leaving now. Wait! Orochimaru!\NPut Sasuke on one more time… Sakura…\NHe can’t hear you anymore. I know… – Sakura… 					– Yeah. Right! That’s right! Now then,\Nit’s about time to say goodbye. Did you all enjoy our special: “The Special Presentation Today!"" The Top 5 Famous\NSweat and Tears Ninja Battles! There Are Also Fun Extras”? Hey, what’re you wrapping things\Nup on your own for? What about my do-over\Nspecial footage? You’re annoying. We don’t have any time left,\Nso wrap things up now! What?! Fine! Unfortunately, my special footage will\Nhave to wait for the next time. But everyone in the village,\Nincluding me, will keep showing\Nawesome fights one after another! Everyone, please continue to support us… – and keep watching “Naruto”!\N– and keep watching “Naruto”! SEE YOU LATER\N		– See you later!\N		– See you later! On a checkerboard night when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing I just can’t come out and say,\N“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.” Suggestively Spat at that beloved face!!\NMister Cricket The Trombone gradually going off-key While on the sweaty center stage\Ndoes bug me. But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel\Nin my undeveloped chest, I wonder if it’s from\Nthat coke I just drank? I never thought that\Nyou were so stubborn! Even if you make a fuss,\Nnothing's going to change. But, at this rate,\Nshe's going to abandon us. It's her choice.\NThere's nothing we can do. Hey, Hinata!\NWhat do you think? We still don't know\Nwhat her situation is… Does that mean that you're with Shino?! It's not like that! Hey, what are you fighting about? Naruto, Sensei is… Kurenai Sensei is going to quit!

37,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. If “Heaven” does not exist, enrich your knowledge,\Nand prepare for the chance. If “Earth” does not exist, run the fields in search\Nof an advantage. Open the series of Heaven and Earth,\Nand the perilous way shall be redressed… This is namely the secret of\N“the one that guides…” What’s that? It probably has to do with the scroll. I think this means we’re supposed\Nto open the Heaven & Earth scroll. Okay then, I’m going to open it. Huh? What’s this? A man…? A person…? This is…a Summoning Jutsu! Naruto! Sakura!\NLet go of the scroll! Oh... Wha--?! Y-You… Hi! It’s been a long time. Surviving the Cut!\NThe Rookie Nine Together Again! W-What’s going on? It appears you guys have had\Na rough time of it. What?! Why are you appearing with\Na Summoning? At the end of this second exam, we Chunin are to\Nwelcome the test-takers. I just happened to be given the important task of being\Nthe messenger for you guys. Messenger…?! Just in time. Everyone… Congratulations on surviving\Nthe second exam. To celebrate your passing, I’d like to treat you to\Nsome Ichiraku ramen, but… Ohh... Cool! Uh-oh… H-Hey, Naruto! – Listen to the end…\N– Cool! Cool! Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it! I’ve done great job!\NI’m the greatest! I so want to eat ramen!\NBelieve it! He’s got so much energy. Yaaaay! Shut up! Man, that scatterbrained part\Nof you is the same as always, eh. I see. Huh? If we had looked at the scroll\Nin the middle of the exam, what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei? Sasuke, you’re a sharp one,\Nas usual. You guessed right. The rules of this exam were to test\Nyour conclusive mission execution ability. To put it simply, in the case of the scrolls being opened\Ncontrary to the rules… In the case of them being opened…? I was ordered to knock unconscious\Nthe test-takers in front of me until the end of the exam. Good thing you didn’t open the scroll. Kabuto, thank you! Phew! That was seriously close… Oh yeah, Sensei! Huh? By the way,\Nwhat’re the letters on that wall? They’re kind of vermiculated and we don’t understand\Ntheir meaning at all. Never mind, never mind! We passed! No…explaining that is\None more of my duties. What, really? I’m saying that’s right. Give it a read. These are Chunin instructions\NMaster Hokage recorded. Instructions?! That’s right! Heaven in this text\Nrefers to the human head. Earth refers to the human body. No kidding… If “Heaven” does not exist, enrich your knowledge,\Nand prepare for the chance. In other words… If your weaknesses are\Ninside your head, Naruto… learn various logics in\Npreparing for your missions. Hah! So meddlesome! If “Earth” does not exist, run through the fields\Nin search of an advantage. If your weaknesses are in\Nyour physical strength, Sakura, it means you must not\Nslack off on your daily training. And if you combine both\NHeaven and Earth… Any perilous mission is the right way… In other words… what can also be called a rule\Nof might and become a safe mission. Then, what about\Nthe spot with the missing letter? The letter refers to Chunin. The one letter for “person” that\Nwas in the scroll from earlier goes there. These five days of survival\Nwere to test the test-takers’ fundamental\Nabilities as Chunin. And you guys cleared it in fine style. Chunin is of unit-leader class. They have the responsibility\Nof leading a team. Be more deeply aware of\Nthe necessity of physical strength… and knowledge in missions! I want you to take on\Nthe next step, never forgetting these\NChunin instructions. That is all of the messenger task\NI was given. Got it! Huh? But, as for the final third exam,\Ndon’t push it too far. Especially you, Naruto. – You’re the biggest worry…\N– Iruka Sensei. From when I received the\NLeaf headband, I was no longer\Nan Academy student, you know?! There’s nothing to worry!\NBelieve it! Also, this is the proof you\Ngave me that I’m full-fledged, right?! That I’m scatterbrained may\Nnot have changed, but I’m not a kid anymore! I'm now... A Ninja! I see. I’m sorry, Naruto. I know their strength the best. If it’s futile anyway, I would like to give them\Nthe final word personally. If you’re that hung up on it,\NI can leave that team to you. To think you’d play the devil’s advocate… Thank you very much. But, they’re Kakashi’s, right? If he’s the one who\Nrecommended them, I thought I could count on them. Stay out of it! They’re not your students anymore.\NThey’re my subordinates now. The one who might truly understand the strength of these kids.\Nmight be you, Kakashi. How is it? Does the Curse Mark still hurt? No. Thanks to you,\Nit’s gotten quite a bit better. Anyway, Orochimaru is one\Nof those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right? He’s a S-rank bingo book\Nrouge Shinobi who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right? I heard that he’d already died, but… Why’d he come to this village now…? There’s a kid I want, you see. This kid inherits the abilities\Nof the Uchiha clan, so… It's... It’s probably Sasuke, right? Huh?! Master Anko! Twenty-one second exam\Nfinishers have been confirmed. As for the third exam, according\Nto the regulations of the Chunin Exams, preliminaries are planned for\Nthe first time in five years. The second exam is over. For the time being,\Ncontinue the exams as is, but while keeping\Nan eye on his movements. Yes… First off, congratulations on\Nfinishing the second exam. There were seventy-eight\Ntest-takers for the second exam. To think twenty-one have\Nmade it this far. I said to make it less than half,\Nbut I’d really thought about single digits. I’m hungry! There are still this many remaining? This is such a major pain. Sasuke and others have passed, too. Of course… We went to that much trouble\Nto save them… It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass. Your team didn’t do too bad. I guess they were lucky. But as long as my team is around,\Nthey can’t go any higher. After all, whether you\Nlike it or not, ability talks at the next barrier. Well, adolescence can sometimes\Nbe bittersweet and can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi… Did you say something? Oh my God! Not bad, my rival Kakashi. But that part of you is so hip...\Nwhich is what annoys me! So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh? Guy Sensei totally loses visually… Guy Sensei is the hippest\Nof all the teachers! He shines! Okay! Please watch, Guy Sensei!\NI’ll shine, too! I don’t ever want to see\Ntears of those dear to me again. So… I won’t ever lose again! Guy Sensei. Sure enough, the outstanding candidates\Nhave gathered. Sasuke Uchiha, eh? I’ll get you back for my arms,\NSasuke Uchiha… At any cost. To think a mere seven teams\Nare left of the twenty-six… Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt. Akamaru’s acting strange… Those Sand Village guys… Naruto passed, too. Thank goodness… What, all the Leaf Village\Nrookies are here. Say! Say! Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and\Neven Intense-Brow are here. Believe it! It feels like everyone’s assembled. Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling. To think this many are left… Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies… So that’s why they fought\N in recommending them. Now then, we will now have\Nthe explanation of the third exam from Master Hokage. Listen carefully, everybody! Now then, if you will,\NMaster Hokage. All right. Before the explanation of\Nthe third exam that we will start from now, I have just one thing I want\Nto tell everyone flat out. About the true purpose of these exams. True purpose…?! Why do allied nations conduct\Nthe exams on a conjoint basis? Huh? Raising the levels of the shinobi\Nand friendship among allied nations. It won’t do to have the wrong idea\Nof the true meaning of that statement. These exams are so to speak… So to speak…? A microcosm of battle\Nbetween allied nations. What does that mean? If we look back on history, the allied nations of today were\Nonce neighboring nations that continued to vie with\Neach other and battle for power. In order to avoid a futile crushing\Nof each others’ military strength, those nations mutually selected\Na place to battle. And that was how the\NChunin Exams originally began. W-Why do we have\Nto do such a thing? We’re not doing this to\Nselect Chunins?! There is no question that these exams\Nare to select Shinobi worthy of becoming Chunin. But on the other hand, these exams also provide a venue for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride\Non their backs to fight for their lives! Nation’s pride…? Many feudal lords and those of\Nprominence from many nations who request Shinobi for work\Nare invited to this third exam as guests. And, the feudal lords and\NHead Ninja of each Village of the nations will watch your battles. If the gap in national power\Nbecomes unbridgeable, the strong nations are inundated\Nwith job requests. The requests of nations deemed\Nweak, on the other hand, decline. And therewithal, we can exert pressure upon\Neach neighboring nation... That is to say, just how much military\Nstrength our Village is developing and has. Even so, why is it necessary for\Nus to fight for our lives?! The nation’s strength is\Nthe Village’s strength. The Village’s strength is\Nthe Shinobi’s strength. And the true strength of the Shinobi\Nis created only in a fight for one’s life! This exam is a place to see\Nthe strength of home country Shinobi, and a place to display this as well. It is because it’s an exam where\Nyou truly fight for your life that this has meaning. It’s for this very reason that\Nyour forerunners fought in this exam, a dream worth striving for. Then why…\Nuse the expression “friendship”?! I said it at the start, didn’t I?! That it won’t do for you to have\Nthe wrong idea of the meaning! It’s a custom where balance is\Npreserved by fighting and removing life. This is the friendship\Nof the Shinobi world. This is a fight for life with\Nthe pride of the village and one’s own dream on the line. Heh, I’m convinced. Anything is fine. Just tell us the content of\Nthat fight-for-life test. Very well. Now then, this is where I’d like to\Nexplain the third exam. But actually… Master Hokage, please allow me,\NHayate Gekko, who was given the task of judge,\N to speak first. I leave it to you… Nice to meet you, everyone… Umm, there’s something…\NI'd like you all to do... before the third exam. Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry, and you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? What's the idea?\NSudden preliminaries? Didn't we just get to the tower?\NAlso, something's wrong with Sasuke. It's too much for you, Sasuke!\NPlease, drop out! You're in no condition\Nto fight properly! No matter what you say, I'm going to tell the teachers\Nabout that bruise. Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field:\NSudden Death Elimination!""

I was also attempting\Nto investigate the true identity of\Nthe Cursed Warrior that day… I was almost sure it couldn’t\Nbe anyone but that person… What a pain! I’ll expose\Nthe true identity here. Don’t bother… Kakashi Sensei.\NWhere were you until now? I’ll explain later.\NGo on ahead! Hurry! You’re going with them. But… Let’s go, Tenten! Wait, Neji! Come on out… You were following me\Nthe whole time, right? If that’s your intention… Summoning Jutsu! What is it, Kakashi? Smoke out the Ninja hiding\Non the temple grounds… Consider it done. Hey! You there… Hide-and-seek is over.\NCome on out now! I can’t fool a dog’s nose,\Nas would be expected… You finally grace me with\Nyour presence, huh? Why is there a hole…\Nin a place like this? I have heard the feudal lord built\Nsecret passages such as this all over the land in order to look in\Non the lives of the general public… The feudal lord?! Then that Cursed Warrior\Nhas something to do with the feudal lord…? At the very least,\Nit seems he’s not a ghost. When the time comes, I’m sure he will reveal\Nhis true identity from his end. Isn’t it common sense for\Nhired Ninja to return quietly to their village\Nafter completing a mission? It’s different in the case of the premise of the commissioned\Nmission breaking down. There were too many\Nsuspicious points in this mission. You’re sticking your nose too far\Ninto the business of another land. Here you could’ve returned safely\Nto your land if you hadn’t secretively\Nsniffed around like a dog. Excuse me for being a dog! Universal Assimilation Jutsu! Prepare yourself! What?! What is this guy?! Has he introduced properties\Nof stone into his body? Since you’ve learned of part\Nof this land’s secrets, I can’t let you live! He seems to be a somewhat\Ntroublesome opponent. Yeah. That’s good enough, Pakkun. I’ll be okay by myself from here on. I see… See you later! Assimilation: Rock Tank. I’ll crush you! A Shadow Clone…?! This is as far as it goes… It can’t be… A Paper Bomb?! Now… That should be enough, right? Huh? Yeah… We should be okay\Nhaving come this far. Th-That voice…?! N-Naruto…! I knew it. The true identity of the Cursed Warrior\Nwasn’t Lord Sagi? Your… Your true identity is… Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi? From the way he was standing still, I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi. There’s a profound reason for this… What’re you doing, Tenten?! Then tell me sooner! It seems you also knew\Nit was Naruto, Neji. Yeah… Ages ago. Jeez, you two! I was really worried! There was a surveillance Shinobi\Nfollowing us the whole time, right? Neji, Tenten…\NDon’t look back. We’re being followed! We’re going back to\Nthe Land of Birds. Just do as I say… Got it?! Y-Yes! Understood… But didn’t we shake the pursuer\Nwith Substitution? Yes… Once… However… when we chased the Cursed Warrior\Nfrom the execution grounds… a different Shinobi followed us. Jeez… Am I the only one\Nwho didn’t know? It was a waste to worry! Then you,\Nin the place of Lord Sagi…? Yeah… I see… So Lord Sagi is safe! You okay, mister?! I’m sorry… That Moso acted rashly, forcing me to make\Na false confession. Man, you’ve been beaten up good… Well, we’ll tell you about\Nthe developments inside. Sagi is waiting! Assimilation: Rock Shower! We’re Wandering Shinobi… We make do without having a village\Nby going around to every village, stealing Jutsu and\Ndevising new Ninjutsu. For example,\Na Jutsu like this one, too… S-Say what? Sharingan! Assimilation: Sand Coffin! He’s using the same Jutsu\Nas Gaara! Assimilation: Sand Funeral! Sagi! How’s Chishima doing…? He’s okay…\NThere’s no threat to his life. He’s resting and receiving treatment in the treatment room\Nof my residence. That’s good… Did something happen to Chishima? Who…? Who hurt him?! Komei… I’m sorry for\Nthe misunderstanding! My lord, I don't deserve\Nthose magnanimous words! Although he had suffered injuries,\NChishima came to tell me. At that time… I must not let you live as is now that you have learned\Nof everything! As the thief who snuck into\Nthe residence of the feudal lord, your fate is the death sentence! No way…! L-Lord Sagi… Chishima?! Bro! Shuriken wounds…? Go to the residence doctor! Lord Sagi… Please listen… Lord Moso, no,\NMoso has betrayed you… What? Moso was the one who killed your father, Lord Owashi,\Nand Lady Toki! And Moso had his own Ninja henchmen\Nuse the guardsmen shuriken to falsely accuse Lord Komei… I’m sure Lord Komei learned\Nof Moso’s scheme and… Hang in there, Chishima! Lord Sagi, please…\NStop Lord Komei’s execution. We have to go save him quickly! I must not stop the execution! Wh-Why is that?! I won’t be able to have my revenge if Moso realizes that\NI have learned the truth… Are you saying it doesn’t matter\Nwho is sacrificed if it’s for the sake of your revenge?! Then what would you do? Komei is being kept under strict watch\Nby powerful soldiers. We would have no chance\Nof winning if theywe were to cause\Na rebellion there… Then I’ll go!\NI will save Komei on my own! You don’t have a problem\Nwith that, do you? Lord Sagi… Do as you like… And so I disguised myself\Nas the Cursed Warrior. I played the part of Cursed Warrior and attempted to look for\Nthe assassination culprit… But against my intentions… Instead of finding\Nthe true culprit… Komei… I was used as a tool\Nto incriminate you. I thought the Cursed Warrior\NI encountered in my bedroom was you, Lord Sagi… And so I headed for\Nthe abandoned temple where the Cursed Warrior\Nonce vanished. There I encountered\Nthe Cursed Warrior, but… That Cursed Warrior wasn’t me. Perhaps it was a fake\Nthat Moso devised. That’s it, believe it!\NAll of it was that old man Moso’s trap! That Moso! Did he think to first dispose\Nof me and then eventually attempt to rule\Nthe Land of Birds by doing away with Lord Sagi? That guy acting like a good guy! I’ll grab him up and kick his butt! Naruto, was it?\NYou did good work. However… I will take care of things\Nfrom here on! Well… But… I will even the score by myself. As long as the score isn’t settled… the clock inside my heart…\Nwill remain stopped in the past! So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here?

Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something Huh, it’s Lady Tsunade. Huh? You guys are… Hey, are you visiting someone\Nat the hospital too? Yes. You too, Lady Tsunade? Well, I guess… She just doesn’t want to stay\Nin the executive office… Shut up! Hinata, don’t faint when\Nyou see Kurenai Sensei. P-Please let's not talk about that. Did something happen? When we were visiting Naruto\Nin the hospital in the past… Shino! This girl fainted when she saw Naruto\Nall covered with bandages. Kiba! I’ll…I’ll be fine this time! I finally found you…! Old Lady Tsunade, I need\Nto talk to you! Huh? Hinata! Naruto… – Naruto is…so close!\N– Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong? Your face looks a little red… Do you have a fever or something? Huh? Hey… H-Hey, Hinata…?! Hey Hinata! Are you okay?!\NGet a hold of yourself! Hinata! Naruto… The Search for\Nthe Rare Bikochu Beetle Hey, you woke up. So Mizuki didn’t know anything,\Nyou said? Tsunade interrogated him herself. He didn’t have any information that would lead to Orochimaru’s\Ncurrent whereabouts… After all, that guy was nothing but\Na disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh. So it seems… We still don’t know where\NSasuke went… And that’s the result after\Na desperate fight with Mizuki… That can’t sit right with\NNaruto either…huh? Please Old Lady Tsunade,\Nsay it’s okay! When I say no, I mean no! As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn’t able\Nto concentrate on her work. Naruto’s been breathing down\Nher neck the whole time asking her to let him go off\Nin search of Sasuke. So she sneaked out\Nof her office, but… He was lying in wait for her here. Naruto… I’ve asked you numerous times already! Please let me go in search\Nof Sasuke! I’ve told you numerous times already.\Nlmpossible! Why! You have some training to do! I can’t because Pervy Sage\Nisn’t around! We have zero leads on either\NOrochimaru and Sasuke. So how are you planning\Nto search for him? I can figure it out somehow! If there aren’t any leads,\NI’ll go find some! So please let me go do it! You’re stubborn, aren't you? You’re stubborn too,\NOld Lady Tsunade! – Please let me go!\N– No, you may not! If I say I’m going, I’m going! Shut up! No means no! Byakugan! All right! Good work, Neji! Move in another half step\Nright there! Yes sir! Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s take a break, Neji. Yes. Have some tea too. Thank you… If Hinata was here,\Nshe should have observed a little. Hinata prepared this…? It would supplement her training\Nby observing… Byakugan! Let’s take a break. Yes. Food! Food! That was pretty well done. I would say that you’re getting closer\Nto perfecting the technique. It’s thanks to you both. You’re so kind to join me\Nin my special training every day… We’re a team. When a comrade in the team\Nis in a fix, one offers a helping hand. That’s only natural… A comrade… If a comrade suddenly disappears, it must be awfully hard. You’re talking about Naruto,\Naren’t you? Isn't there some way\Nwe could help him? I’d like to help him out in\Nsome way too…but… Lady Hokage was telling Naruto… that there are no leads at all. There may be one resource… Really?! I’m talking about Bikochu. Bikochu? Are you talking about\Nthose rare insects…?! I have heard that they had\Nbecome extinct some time ago. Since there was a possibility\Nthat they could become extinct, the Aburame Clan discontinued\Nusing them, so a miniscule number of them\Nshould still be alive. Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu? Well…it’s not surprising that\Nyou don’t know about them. The last time that Bikochu\Nwere used was before the last Great War… Bikochu are one kind of insect\Nused by insect handlers. Larvae which have hatched from eggs\Nbecome chrysalises in no time at all, then emerge and turn\Ninto imagos. They are then made to\Nrecognize scents… and they are able to track\Neven the faintest scent… to its source. Their olfactory sense is several thousand\Ntimes greater than a Ninja Hound's. They are insects capable of\Nexhibiting that skill in an exceptional way. However, Bikochu lay eggs\Nonly once every several years… This year is actually the year\Nin which they lay eggs. And right now is exactly\Nthe time when they hatch. I see. There are still some of\NSasuke’s belongings left in the village… Right? If one makes the Bikochu,\Nrecognize that scent… We may be able to locate\NSasuke’s whereabouts, right? What is the probability\Nof finding a Bikochu? Frankly speaking, not very high.\NPerhaps 10%. 10% huh… As you guys know, the situation in the village\Nis currently very grave… We don’t have the leeway of allowing\Neven Genin to sit around and play. However, fortunately or unfortunately,\NKurenai has been hospitalized, so you guys, Squad Eight,\Nno longer have a mission. Rather than just letting\Nyou sit around and play, I’d rather place my bet\Non that 10% possibility. Huh… you mean… Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka.\NHinata Hyuga. I order you to search for\Nthe Bikochu! – All right! 					– All right! I designate Shino\Nas the leader this time. And…that spy up there! Oww…! Naruto… You’re going to go even if\NI try to stop you, right? Yup! In that case, I have no choice\Nbut to let you go… However… This is your last chance. If you don’t find the Bikochu… you must give up on Sasuke! Wha--? You understand?! It’ll be fine…\NI’ll find it without fail. All right. You won’t go back\Non your word, right? Yeah! Leave it to me! You’re easily pleased, aren’t you? Owww! Naruto… Sasuke… Hinata. Good morning. Neji will be here soon\Nfor his training… Please prepare tea as always. Well… Huh? What’s the matter? I need to go…\Non a mission starting now… A mission, huh… In that case, it can’t be helped… I’m heading out… Don’t be a burden to the others. Yes, sir! I’m…I’m sorry! I’m in a hurry… The way she handled\Nher physical response just now… Hinata… You’re late, Hinata! I’m sorry! All right then! Let’s head out! Let’s go! Huh? Why are you walking at\Nsuch a leisurely pace?! It takes a Shinobi two days on foot to get to the habitat of\Nthe Bikochu … There’s no need to make haste\Nfrom the very start. But what if the eggs hatch\Nbefore we get there? The eggs of Bikochu only hatch\Non the day after it’s rained… There’s no sign of it\Nraining any time soon… But…if by some remote chance… Naruto. Wh-What is it? I am the leader of this team. While we are on this mission,\Nyou will obey the orders of your leader. Kiba, I can’t believe you’re able\Nto work with that kind of guy… Well, I’ve gotten used to it… I’m sure you’ll bond with him too, Naruto. I wonder about that… Naruto and the others\Nleft a while ago. I see. Didn’t you want to go too? When it comes to searching\Nfor insects, Shino, who’s an insect handler,\Nis number one… And then Hinata who has Byakugan… and Kiba and Akamaru who have\Nsensitive noses are there too… So there’s really no role that\NI could play! What I must do right now… is to become a Medical Ninja\Nas soon as I possibly can! What’s the matter, Shino?! The sun’s going down.\NWe’re setting up camp. Got it. – Huh? 					– Okay. Huh? What…?! We’re gonna set up\Ncamp already?! I’m not tired at all yet!\NLet’s go further! Naruto, the leader of\Nthis team is me. I-I understand! Okay then…let’s sleep. Huh…we’re gonna sleep already?! Many animals and plants\Ngo to sleep at sunset and awake at sunrise. In order to search for insects, we must understand the rhythm\Nof living creatures with our own bodies… But…the sun’s just set… Naruto, I am the leader of this team… Okay, okay. I got it! There’s no way\NI can sleep so early… Yeah, right… All that complaining and guess\Nwho's the first one to fall asleep? I have to pee… Huh? Huh? What’s that? It’s a waterfall… Hey… Is somebody there? S-Say… Damn it…! S-Sorry. Did I scare you? Huh? There’s nobody there… Huh, Naruto…\NDid you catch a cold? Yeah…a little… After sleeping so much\Nyou’re still tired? Well, uh… When I woke up last night to pee,\NI saw something awesome… Did you catch a cold too, Hinata? No, I’m okay… And…what was that awesome thing? It was a beautiful woman\Nin the middle of the waterfall! Huh? When that person moved her arms,\Nthe water would suddenly move too! It was awesome! And what happened then… When I tried to speak to her,\Nshe suddenly vanished. You must have been dreaming\Nor something. It's starting to feel that way… You idiot! Your face is red, Hinata. You might have really\Ncaught a cold. Huh…really, I’m fine… This fruit is edible.\NThis will be our meal today. Got it. We can save on\Nour food supplies too. There’s one thing\NI need to warn you about. On rare occasions, this fruit grows\Nto the size of a human being. However, those fruits\Nare damaged inside. Don’t tamper with them\Nunder any circumstance. There’s nobody who would\Neat something that huge. N-Naruto…! He’s eating it… Naruto… We’re going on ahead… I’ll…I’ll be right behind you! Sorry to keep you waiting! Wait just a second! Hey…aren’t we there yet? Yes. We're here! What…? Wow! I’ve never seen anything\Nlike this before. This certainly isn’t a place\Nwhere humans could inhabit. That’s right…\NThat’s why it’s paradise for insects. D-Don’t tell me… Could it be that…over there…? You mean that’s where\Nthe Bikochu are? No problem.\Nlt’s better than the Chunin Exam. Damn…The foothold crumbles easily… – Naruto… 					– What? As the leader, I’m warning you… At a time like this,\Nwhat is it?! Don’t fall. I already know that\Nwithout your telling me! Naruto! No way…! That was close… Those were insects, huh… That’s why I warned you. When this mission is over, I’m definitely gonna kick\Nthat guy’s butt! This is…the Bikochu forest. Let’s go. There’s no mistake.\NThose are Leaf Shinobi. The fact that those guys came to\Na place like this means their objective is… Yeah…it’s the same as ours…\Nthe Bikochu. We’re not gonna let them\Ntake any Bikochu. The Bikochu, …\Nbelong to us, the Kamizuru Clan! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah Huh! If you’re talking about\Nthe insect in this photograph, I’m very familiar with it. – Huh? 					– Really?! Damn…Don’t tell me\Nthat was a Bikochu? Where did you see it? I heard some rustling in the kitchen\Nin the middle of the night, and I unintentionally threw\Na slipper at it… Wait a second… N-Naruto… What you’re talking about\Nis an ordinary cockroach.

31,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. Ugh... what are you here for now? It’s our reunion after so long,\Nand you’re awfully cold. Don’t tell me that you came to\Nassassinate Lord Hokage? No, no… I don’t have enough\Nsubordinates for that yet... I’ve heard of the excellence ones\Nof this village and thought I’d put dibs on them. A little while ago, I gave that\Nsame Curse Mark as a present. There’s a kid that I want. Selfish as always. That kid will die. Certainly… The odds are 1 in 10\Nthat he’ll survive, but he may survive just like you did. This kid, you really like him, huh? Are you jealous? Are you still holding a grudge that\NI used you and threw you away? Unlike you, that kid will excel... For one thing, he inherited\Nthe Uchiha ability. He has beautiful features and is a vessel who\Ncan become my heir. If that kid lived,\Nit makes things interesting. Be sure not to cancel this test. Three from my village are also\Nunder your care… Make me enjoy it. If something happens\Nto deprive me of my fun, consider it the end of Leaf Village. We’ve secured food and water\Nafter spending half a day. And now most teams have halted activity. As we planned,\Nthis is the time that we attack. We'll split up into three\Nand go scouting. However, whether we find\Nother teams or not, we return to this place. Got it? Okay. Roger. Okay. Scatter! Bushy-Brow’s Pledge:\NUndying Love and Protection! I can’t fall asleep... I need to protect these two. I slept great! Naruto! Sasuke! Did you take care of us? Thank you, Sakura! We’re totally better because of you! That’s good... A prey must always stay tense\Nand flee desperately in front of the predator! My voice is gone! It was just a dream... Is it daybreak already?! No, no way! A squirrel? Don’t surprise me like that! Oh! That was too close. Do you think she noticed? The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel... No, that’s not it. Huh? Then what? What was it? We’ll probably find out if we go closer. So... we should get going now. If I can catch all twenty of these leaves\Nbefore they hit the ground Sakura will start to like me. If... if I can’t catch\Neven one of the leaves...! It’ll be an unanswered love forever.\NOr rather… You’re too Bushy! That’s what she’ll say. One, two, three, four...\Nfive, six, seven, eight... nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,\N fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen... One more! That’s…! Phew... just in time. This is called a Paper Bomb\Nand it explodes after some time. Who did such an awful thing? Stop hiding and come out. Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?! Man, he’s a damn pain\Nand we've been discovered! Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,”\Nwas a failure! So now we carry out Strategy Two! Huh? Are you serious? What? You have a problem with that? There’s no question of success. Well, I guess it’s all right but... Wow! To meet last year’s Number One\Nrookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this! C-Can I have your autograph? So it’s just you guys? Take that! Strategy Two, “head over heals\Ninfatuation with my sex appeal”! I’d been wanting to meet you\Nfor some time, you know? Get lost! Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?! Shoot, it ticks me off, darn! Did you just raise your fists to me,\Nand does that mean you want to fight? N-No... 					Of course not. Then get lost. Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps\N like you would only make me\Nthe laughing stock of the village. Y-Yes! Huh... Really just like cockroaches. Just as I thought. A fellow like that wouldn’t take\Na scroll away from wimps like us unless we were to turn on him. All right! Let’s go find some wimps! Like I’ve been saying\Nthere’s no one wimpier than us... So a no-sleep lookout? But it’s not necessary anymore. Wake Sasuke up.\NWe want to battle with him. Y-You bastards… What’re you saying? What is it you’re after? I know the one called Orochimaru\Nis calling the shots from the shadows! Huh?! What’s that strange bruise on\Nthe back of Sasuke’s neck? You did this to Sasuke. How can you say you want to fight him?! I wonder…what he has on his mind? However, I can’t stay quiet\Nafter hearing that. I will kill this girl,\NI’ll also kill this Sasuke character. Wait, Zaku. Huh? What is it? It’s so cliché. It’s the color of dirt\N that’s just been dug up. This grass, it doesn’t grow in\Na place like this, does it? Darn! You know, with a trap... there’s no point unless you\Nmake it so it’s not discovered. Huh, how ridiculous! So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel\Nwouldn’t be caught in the trap ? We kill her now! A log?! A trap above too? Watch out! Just kidding. What?! Clearly you have no talent. Someone like you needs to\Nmake more of an effort or else! Leaf Hurricanes! What?! This guy... Then you also should... make an effort! Who are you? I’m the beautiful blue beast\Nof Leaf Village, Rock Lee! Why are you here? I will always appear... whenever you’re in trouble! Or should I say... It was really because of you,\Nnow run along. But right now, I’m also\Nyour enemy! I did say this once before, didn’t I? That I’ll protect you until I die. Please go out with me! I’ll protect you until I die! Oh... T-Thanks. Yes! Perfect! I did it!\NGu Sensei, that was perfect! I guess it can’t be helped... Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke. I will kill them! As far as I can tell,\N Sakura is in no condition to fight. That Bushy-Brow guy is\N pretty proficient with Taijutsu... Looks like I can have some fun! There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there? I won’t just simply avoid it. You showed me your Jutsu before. This guy…he’s strong. Having said that, the odds aren’t good since\Nit’s one versus three. I’m gonna have to take a chance. One person at a time... I’ll give it my all and take each down! There’s no one at all that seems wimpy! Well, the only team that’s weaker\Nthan us is the Naruto team. Idiot! You know what you’re saying? What?! No question Naruto and Sakura are lame! But that team has\Nthe super genius Sasuke! Hah! I wonder... In actual battle that genius\Nmight easily be beaten. What?! All right, all right,\NI apologize for irritating you. What a pain... I say one negative thing about\NSasuke and I get the evil eye, every time… There’s no way Sasuke\Ncould be taken down! Sakura’s a different matter though! Huh?! Hey! Sasuke has collapsed... Huh?! ...and Sakura is fighting. What did you say? Hey! He’s late. That Lee... Something’s not right. He’s always precise about time. Perhaps he ran into the enemy... Could it be...? Huh, that wouldn’t have happened. In any case, let’s find Lee! Right! Yes! I’ve finally mastered it!\NYes! Yes! My friends, there’s no reason\Nto give up on your youth! This Jutsu... In the end, only Lee\N could make it his own. Yahoo! – Hey Lee...\N– I did it! I will do it! – Lee! 					– When I try! I try! Hey, Lee! Hey! Listen to this passionate message\Nfrom your teacher! Oh... what is it?! Please tell me using hip words. This Jutsu, the “Lotus”... it will be dealt with henceforth\Nas a forbidden Jutsu. – What?! 					– Huh?! W-What do you mean? This Jutsu poses a great burden\Non the cells of the muscles, it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.” Humans normally utilize,\Nat most, 20 percent... of the “power” that the muscles have. Do you understand?\NOnly 20 percent! And if nearly 100 percent\Nof the “power” is used the muscles themselves will disintegrate. So, the brain usually controls the “power.” However, this Jutsu forces the\Nbrain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra, allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu... In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu\Nwhich relies on a secret technique that brings forth “power” almost\N to the limit of one’s body. So the only time it is all right\Nto use this Jutsu is when a certain condition is met... So... when is that? Take this to heart... The condition is Guy Sensei... I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve. Because this is the time you said... ""When protecting a previous person!"" He disappeared?! Oh, oh no! There's no way he can break his fall! Take this! Primary Lotus! This feeling... Well well... Just in time. T-That's impossible! That is a frightening Jutsu... It did this much even though\NI fell on the spongy dirt. It's now my turn. Oh no! With what I just did... Lee! Your Jutsu is indeed fast. But our Jutsu exceeds that and is the speed of sound! I'll show you there are walls which effort alone can never break through. Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry, and you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? I'm so frustrated! I'm just pulling feet again. I'm always just being protected.

As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Multiple Traps!\NCountdown to Destruction This many Paper Bombs…\Nis a diversion? Y-Yes! No way… No. He’s a man who\Nwould go that far… After all, he is Genno\Nthe Trapper! Remember. Think.\NHis actions thus far… His intent hidden in there. First he steals the blueprints\Nfor key facilities in the village and pretends to blow himself up\Nin front of the Anbu Black Ops. Because of the incident, an S-Level Emergency\NSecurity Alert is given… The village becomes poorly manned… and Genno is able to\Nmove around as he pleases… Then why did he scatter\Nthe blueprints he stole? With this incident, it becomes evident\Nthat Genno might still be alive so the guys on watch outside\Nend up returning to the village as quickly possible… Could that have been his objective? He directed everyone’s attention\Nto the Paper Bombs and reassembled\Nthe village Shinobi. If his aim is to\Nset up something there… Could it be…? The Paper Bombs in the village\Nwere a decoy? You can’t see the Paper Bombs\Nin this room? What’s this?! What’s up with these Paper Bombs? Do you know the geological conditions of the Great Stone Faces? G-Geological conditions…? To be precise, the geological condition\Nof this plateau which the Great Stone Faces\Nare carved into. The plateau towering behind\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves is made of extremely hard rock. But this rock has narrow lines\Nrunning through it, you see… It can be easily broken if power\Nis applied along those lines. The Great Stone Faces\Nwere created using this… This time and thirty years ago aren’t the only times I’ve come\Nto the Leaf… I’ve visited the Leaf several times\Nand checked things out… And then I finally determined it… I determined how to set Paper Bombs\Nto destroy this plateau! Wha--?! I’m fairly certain\Nno one would imagine the destruction of\Nthe Great Stone Faces… Especially when we’re in the middle of Paper Bomb\Nremoval operations. We wouldn't even think\Nabout the Great Stone Faces… But if that entire plateau were\Nto slide down and crumble… The Village Hidden in the Leaves… would be completely buried\Nin earth and sand! The Village Hidden in the Leaves… It would be destroyed! Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage\Nimmediately! Make sure the guys who return\Ndon’t enter the village… Shikamaru, be happy! Guy Sensei and the others\Nhave come back! Hurry, hurry!\NNow that Might Guy has returned, we won’t let the enemy do\Nas he pleases! Too late, huh…? What’s the matter…? Shikamaru! Naruto has…! Why…? Why destroy\Nthe whole village…? If you do that,\Nmany innocent people will die. And all the buildings you built\Nwill be destroyed. Is that what you want?! You may think revenge is\Nyour last job or whatever, but something like\Nthis is absolutely mistaken. If you’re going to go through\Nwith this no matter what… I’ll stop you! That’s impossible. No way will I let you detonate\Nthe Paper Bombs! Nope. I won from the moment\Nyou set foot in here. Even if you defeat me, the triggering device will activate\Nthe instant you leave this place. It seems everyone has returned… I guess I’ll be activating\Nthe triggring device… The Village Hidden in the Leaves\Nshall meet the same fate as Heat Devil Village! I won’t let that happen! Shadow Clone Jutsu! It’s over! It’s useless to resist… It’s impossible for you alone\Nto disarm all of my traps. No doubt, it might be impossible\Nfor me alone… but I’ve got friends! But didn’t you do nothing\Nbut badmouth them at Ichiraku? Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot\Nand they tick me off sometimes… But they’re my friends! They’re Shinobi\Nwho will protect the Leaf with me! No matter what traps you set… they’ll manage somehow,\Nno matter what! Then, I’ll finish everything before that. You won't be able to stop them this time! Fang Over Fang…! I’d say that was a close shave, huh? Kiba! Akamaru!\NHow’d you know I was here…? Thank Hinata! She thought it was strange that\Nyou’d leave for no reason, so she frantically searched\Nfor you with her Byakugan. But the Byakugan shouldn’t\Nbe that versatile… I'm surprised you found us… Well, we had a pretty good idea\Nof where you were… Shikamaru said that the final trap\Nwould be in the Great Stone Faces. Shikamaru did…? I see… This means I shouldn’t take\Nyoung opponents lightly, huh…? Right. You misjudged our power… Th-These are…insects?! That’s right…\NYou’re finished now. Get down, you two! Old man… He blew himself up! No, that’s not it! It’s a Substitution… It seems he switched just before\Nbeing covered with the insects… It’s over now… Wh-What’s this…? It’s the Shadow Strangle Jutsu… You anticipated my actions…? Yup. Checkmate, old man.\NCome on right over here… Choji, restrain him. Got it… Oh, shoot! His shadow…! Shikamaru… What did he do…? He had set it so a smoke screen\Nwould activate if he were touched by an enemy. Choji, to the right! Human Boulder! The Leaf is now finished! A strike? Why won't…\Nthe Paper Bomb explode? Tough luck… We already disarmed that Paper Bomb. And we disarmed all\Nthe triggering devices set inside the Great Stone Faces. This is as far as you go old man… That’s right…\NPrepare yourself! It’s useless to run! I don’t know how incredible of\Na Trapper you are. But my friends’ teamwork\Nis better than you are! I must not give up here… Give up, already! No matter what you set up,\Nwe’ll stop it! I wouldn’t be able…\Nto show my face to my son… Where’d he…? Over there! It seems you haven’t disarmed\Nall of the triggering devices… I…win! The village! Don’t be fooled, guys!\NThis is a Genjutsu! Release! Naruto! Huh? Wh-What? Summoning Jutsu! He's planning to get on that bird\Nand escape! Leave it to me! Mind Transfer Jutsu! All right! It’s a success… – Ino…! 					– Hey! Why’d you break the Jutsu?! What’s the matter? His body… It really hurt… He’s fighting while enduring\Na lot of pain in his body! I won’t let you escape! Naruto… Sure enough… I’m no match for a young person\Nat Taijutsu, huh…? It’s not like that… You’re a quite the practitioner\Nof Taijutsu… Now it’s finally over! It’s not over yet… What? What do you mean…\Nit’s not over yet? Where’s the bird he summoned earlier? Oh! Over there! There are Paper Bombs on its feet! What?! The Mountainside Image of\Nthe Third Hokage is the spot where I restored a crack… I used a device different\Nfrom the others… That cracked section is slightly\Nmore fragile than the other areas… I set an triggering device\Nthat takes advantage of that… If there an explosion occurs there, the other Paper Bombs\Nwill explode at once. Going so far as to set a device\Nin such a place… To think we overlooked that…! That means he summoned\Nthat bird to activate the device?! At last…my wish will come true… Here it comes! I'll use this… It dodged them! We can’t bring it down with\Na long-range attack?! I’ll defend the Leaf,\Nno matter what! I’ll blow him away with the Rasengan\Nbefore he slams into this place! Shadow Clone Jutsu! What?! What?! Partial Expansion Jutsu!\NBoth arms! Naruto, use my hands! Thanks, Choji! H-Hinata?! U-Umm…Shikamaru told me to read\Nthat bird’s movements with my Byakugan\Nand to give you directions… Huh…? I leave the rest to you! All right, let’s go, Hinata! R-Right! Byakugan! Not yet… Draw it closer… It’ll be okay. No matter what, I’ll protect the village the Third Hokage\Nrisked his life to protect! Naruto… Now! Rasengan! It vanished?! Up above! Damn it. Reach! You little! What? Did something happen…? All right! Yes! We did it, Hinata! N-Naruto… The inside of his body\Nis in terrible shape… It’s amazing that he lived until today. Old man… It’s too bad…\NI failed to leave my name in history… But…I had…fun… What? What do you mean, old man?! What do you mean you had fun?! Old Man Genno! Naruto? 					No, it’s not… “My son proud as a peacock having\Nbeaten me at treasure hunting…” Treasure hunting…? Did you notice…? Huh? The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty\Nin this incident… Old Man Genno!\NOpen your eyes! Old Man Genno!! I figured it out, Shikamaru… It seems the person in this picture\Nis Genno’s real son… Son…? It seems he became\Na Shinobi like his father… but lost his life right after that\Nwhen the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village. I bet he wanted to avenge his own son… So he did something like this… No doubt, at first he may have\Ninfiltrated the village for revenge… At first…? Something was kind of bugging me, so I checked out the triggering device\Nthat was set in the Academy one more time. There was a loose connection\Nin one spot. It was set up so it wouldn’t activate\Neven if the target were hit… Wasn’t that just Genno’s mistake…? Genno was a first-rate Trapper. It’s unlikely he’d make such\Na simple mistake… No doubt about it… The same goes for the traps in\Nthe Great Stone Faces… There were some defective bombs\Nmixed in with the Paper Bombs. Even if the traps were activated, there's a strong possibility that they'd only make a few cracks\Nin the Great Stone Faces. Then he had no serious intention\Nof smashing the Leaf? Then…for what purpose…? Treasure hunting… What do you mean treasure hunting? It makes more sense\Nto think of it like that. In other words, he infiltrated\Nthe village for the sake of revenge, but he changed his mind\Nafter meeting Naruto who was a spitting image\Nof his son… He probably knew that\Nhe didn’t have long to live. If he was going to do something\Nbefore dying, he wanted it to be\Nthe thing he found most fun… He probably wanted to re-enact\Nhis treasure-hunts with his son… using the traps he set to smash the Leaf. So that’s what it was. Well, it’s just conjecture, though. So that old man…\Nwasn’t a bad person… I told you from the start. Those who like Ichiraku's ramen\Ncan't be bad people! What? But in actuality,\Ndidn’t he hate ramen? Ichiraku ramen is different! There’s no way you can keep\Neating something you hate every day. Exactly! Old man… Naruto…? The enemies who come to the Leaf\Nwon’t always be like this. Someone like Orochimaru\Nmight attack again! That means we must\Nalways be prepared! Right! It’s a pain, though… I’ll eat in preparation for that! We’ll protect the Leaf Village! With all of us working together… On a checkerboard night when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing I just can’t come out and say,\N“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.” Suggestively Spat at that beloved face!!\NMister Cricket The Trombone gradually going off-key While on the sweaty center stage\Ndoes bug me. But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel\Nin my undeveloped chest, I wonder if it’s from\Nthat coke I just drank? Thank you all for your support!

I… Just something… I came to check out this training field. This is the place where\NI became Genin, so… Really? W-Why? N-Nothing…That doesn’t matter! Y-You’re right. I’m sorry. Say, Hinata… Neji’s a relative of yours, right? Y-Yes. Is he really strong …? Yes… I see. B-But you might be able to win, Naruto. Yeah. I’m strong, after all! I bet you can win, Naruto. What? You know… I…when you cheered for me, I felt like I was able to become\Nstronger than before. Hinata! Hang tough! When the preliminaries ended, I became able to like\Nmyself just a little. I'll… stand… by my own… words. That is my way of Ninja. From someone else's standpoint,\Nit might not look like anything’s changed… but I feel like I was able to change. I’ve been thinking that it was…\Nthanks to you, Naruto. Say, Hinata… Did you really think so? What? I may look strong to you, but all I do is mess up… And I act tough because\NI’m frustrated. It’s not like that! Even when you messed up, in my view…you were always\Na proud failure. W-When I look at you,\Nit impacts my heart. You’re not perfect, so… So… It’s because you mess up… that you have the strength\Nto rise up from that. I think such strength is\Ntrue strength. I…I think you’re an\Nincredibly strong person. Thanks, Hinata! Even though I was always\Nthe bottom one… I was tense in the shoulders, somehow! I was depressed,\Nwhich was totally not my character. But I feel better now! Naruto… Okay! I’m off to the match! Hinata… Huh? I kind of…thought you were… W-What…? …gloomy, hesitant and weird. Naruto… But I quite like…people… like you! …like you! Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me\Nkick that Neji’s butt! Uh-oh. Time to run! I-I’m late, late! See you later, Hinata! Sorry I’m late, Hinata. Well, Shino’s match isn’t until\Nquite a bit later, so… Hm? Hey? Hinata? Hmm? W-What? Oh, it’s starting! Move, move! C'mon, move! Dang it! There’s quite a distance! I won’t make it! Brother Naruto! Konohamaru?! I’ve come to aid in brother’s crisis, here!

45,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. I'm going... to become the Hokage. I can’t lose here! You? Hokage?! When you’re weaker than me? I’ll become... Hokage for you! Transform! Hey hey, are you serious? You’ve been here three years and you can’t even do\Na respectable transformation?! All of you watch now! I will absolutely someday become\Nthe true and a real Hokage! Lame! What Hokage?! You know deep down inside that\Nyou can’t become the Hokage. So quit acting tough! You’re wrong Kiba… If you compete with me for\Nthe name of Hokage… You... will be the loser! Surprise Attack!\NNaruto's Surprise Weapon! Man! Same thing over and over again.\NYou're pesky! Well, never mind. I’ll just make it so\Nyou won’t stand up again! Let’s go, Akamaru! You think you can get me with\Nthat same technique again?! Take this! Darn! Fang Over Fang! This Jutsu… Though, I’ve seen it before… it’s not a Jutsu you can dodge\Nover and over! What do I do? What should I do?! Looks like you’ve got nothing left. I’ve got plenty left! Even if you increased yourself by\Nthree or four, I’d still have a lot left! You’ve got a comeback\Nfor everything! Let’s finish him with the next!\NAkamaru! Darn! I have to counterattack somehow. Even if I do, it has to get Kiba\Nor there’s no point! But which is which…? W-What will you do? Naruto! Naruto… T-That’s it! Transform! You’re mine! I see how it is… Huh? There, look closely. Oh! You did it! That’s a clever move, Naruto! Naruto! If he transforms into Kiba, the real Kiba doesn’t know which is\NAkamaru and which is Naruto… He can’t attack carelessly. However, it’s okay for Naruto\Nto attack either one! Oooh! He created a chance opening… Good work! I see, so that’s your move… But… I’ll give you a piece of advice! I was careless before and\Na little late to realize it… But the Transformation Jutsu\Nisn’t effective anymore! Why, you ask? Yeah! I can smell you. Don’t mess with our\Nsense of smell, Naruto. By concentrating his Chakra\Ninto his nose, Kiba’s sense of smell is enhanced tens\Nof thousands times more than average. Of course, he can determine\Npeople by their smell too. Heh, I won! W-What?! What's going on?! Kiba’s nose got Naruto and\NAkamaru mixed up? Darn! What in the world is going on…?! Then you’re Naruto! Messing with me! What?! Well, this is coming from\Nthe original prankster, after all… He’s had it! He did it! Naruto… Awesome! Darn it! So that’s it… Naruto, transformed into Kiba, was discovered by the real Kiba\Nwith smell and hit… But Naruto didn’t come back\Nin true Naruto form. Instead, he transformed into\NAkamaru instantly! In order to make it look as if it\Nwas Akamaru who was hit and his impersonation\Ntransformation dissolved! Was Naruto ever that smart…? You little…! Think hard about your Jutsu\Nbefore you use them! Because they’ll be used\Nagainst you, stupid! He’s using my line, word to word… Arguing with this guy is only\Na waste of time! Don’t go at Naruto’s pace… Calm down. Calm down! He can’t actually keep up with\Nmy movements yet… I still have the advantage! Look closely at Naruto’s movements\Nand if there’s an opening… I can surely take him from\Nbehind with the All-Four Jutsu. Nothing to get flustered about… If I do this in a level-headed manner,\Nit’s a match I will most certainly win! Evidently your enemy\Nhas become calm… Well, what will you do, Naruto…? So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba? Well then... I’ll end this… with my new special technique\NI’ve been saving up! So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba? Well then... I’ll end this… with my new special technique\NI’ve been saving up! What?! New special trick?! Huh? When did he…?! Leave it to Naruto to hide\Na new technique! What new special technique! That’s obviously a bluff! You can test out whether\Nit’s a bluff or not! This hasn’t changed since before… Don’t let his pace get to you. Calm down! Let’s go! I don’t know what kind of\Ntechnique this is but…! I just won’t let you do it! Now! Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…\NAll-Four Jutsu! Q-Quick… Why are you stopping?! Naruto! Naruto! Just as I thought, this is as\Nfar as he will go. Stand up! Naruto! D-Darn! I don’t even have time\Nto work up my Chakra! Hey hey! What’s wrong?! Naruto! He’s fast! It’s no good. He doesn’t have time to\Nform hand Signs! There’s too much of a difference\Nin their strength… It’s impossible for Naruto, after all. Naruto… D-Darn! Take this! What?! Take that! I’m going to be Hokage! I won’t lose here! Whatever! You can’t keep up\Nwith my speed at all! Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey! Naruto! This is what it’s like when\NI really let it out. You understand, don’t you? To me, you’re merely…! I... Huh? will absolutely not lose! That Naruto… He’s a fighter. Yup. If I were Kiba,\NI’d be sick of this already. It doesn’t matter which anymore,\NI just wish they’d settle it quickly. Naruto... Fight! Naruto! Use the new technique\Nor whatever! Just settle it! Naruto! Go for it! I have to find some opening\Nin that darn Kiba… You’ve got absolutely no effect on me! You’ve got spirit, I’ll give you that! He’s close at his end… I’ll settle it with the next one! I’ll make the new technique\Nexplode no matter what! I won’t let you! You’re slow! Take this! Oops! Fast movements and a keen nose… The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry\Nturned out to be harmful… Right now Kiba’s sense of smell\Nis tens of thousands times more powerful than normal… Well… That fart was probably\Na freak accident, but… That’s what you’d expect from\Nthe number one unpredictable Ninja. Naruto! Now’s your chance! Darn!\NI was straining too much… But now’s the time to show\Nmy new technique! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Naruto! Okay! The way you’ve torn me\Napart up until now, I’ll give it back all at once! D-Darn it! U-! Zu-! Ma-! Ki-! Naruto... Barrage! A new technique, eh? Well, he was watching Sasuke’s\Ntechnique a moment ago… Lion Barrage! For the record, the name\Nis a rip off, too. The winner is Naruto Uzumaki. Ohhhh! Cha! Nice one! You did it! That Naruto beat Kiba! It’s a major upset… Yup! Yes! I’m…getting stronger! That was easy! W-What to do? What should I do…? N-Naruto... Huh? Hinata? Did you say something? Ah, ah, ah… 					Umm… Huh? Hinata…? What's this? It’s an ointment. Why for me? Take it for her, Naruto. Hmmm. Okay! Thank you! You’re nice, Hinata! Kiba, it’s nothing to be\Nembarrassed about … This kid was a really\Nstrong opponent. You are taking this pretty easy,\Naren’t you, Lady Hinata…? Hey, can you hear it?

When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Wait, Naruto! I won’t wait. I told you not to be acting\Non your own. Then you’re saying to\Nleave Sumaru be?! Sumaru just now seemed\Nquite upset… He’s definitely intending to\Nget revenge on Akahoshi. Now that he’s been tarred with\Nthe reputation of Rogue Ninja, he’ll have no place to go\Nthroughout his life if he raises a hand against\Nthe village leader. Hokuto? Mother! I finally… Here, I finally got to meet you… Mother. The Star's Radiance Wh-What’re you doing? Shh! Don’t be acting on\Nyour own anymore. But, something’s strange. This number of Ninja is\Nindeed something serious. It seems they’ve mobilized all\Nof the village Ninja. Anyway, we should see\Nhow things go for a little while. Byakugan! Sumaru’s inside the training room… Hey, what about Sumaru’s mom? Damn it! Sumaru… Do we really have to do away\Nwith him? He’s still a kid.\NWouldn’t it be okay to let things slide? At this moment,\Nhe’s a dangerous element. No good would come\Nof letting him live. But Sumaru’s been\Nthe most effective Genin in the village. We have more than\Nenough materials… We can just train more… Materials…?! I won’t stand for it anymore!\NLeave it to me! – Forget about it.\N– Let go of me! I’m going to kick\Nthat Akahoshi jerk’s butt. This is a Star Village issue. Village issues have to be resolved\Nby those in the village. Isn’t there something\Nwe can do for him? That’s right. Let’s charge on in and\Nbox Akahoshi’s ears… What’re you saying? That’d be the same as Naruto! Are you saying we must\Nremain idle spectators even when things have gone this far?! That’s right! As long as there’s no commission from\Nthe village to kick Akahoshi’s butt, there’s nothing we can do. Archer unit! Forward! Fire! Until now, I felt resentment towards you,\NMother, for leaving me behind. But…I understand clearly now. I understand why you\Nhad to do that. Akahoshi… I will never forgive him! Sumaru… Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?! What’re you talking about…? I buried them both together…\NThere is no greater happiness. Incredible Chakra! Wait! This jerk’s an enemy...\NHe suddenly attacked. You’re Leaf Shinobi, right? I can tell even if you give me\Nthe runaround… The people from other lands\Nare all after the star. If you have that power, you can stand above all of\Nthe Hidden Villages. Is your awesome Chakra also\Nthe power of the star? If they had that star, would everyone have\Nthe same Chakra as you? No! The more tremendous the power, the more hard work is required\Nto control it! I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard! I’ll become the Hoshikage! Yeah! I look forward to working\Nwith you at that time! I’m also going to become\Nthe Hokage someday, believe it! You’re a strange guy. Really? That red star sure is pretty… Natsuhiboshi… It watches over me all the time… Are you still gonna say\NI should bear it after all this? Sumaru! Sumaru… Listen, everyone. If you continue the star training,\Nyou’ll all die. Sumaru’s mother is the one\Nwho took away the star. She did that in order to\Nprotect everyone’s lives! Lord Akahoshi? Is it true that we’ll die? Are you going to believe\Nsuch nonsense?! Being unable to withstand\Nthe star training is because the heart that loves\Nthe village is weak! Those who really love the village\Ncan become true Shinobi and can also surpass the Hidden Villages\Nof the Five Great Nations! Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi…\NWho’s telling the truth? Mizura?! In that condition…!\Nlt’s reckless! Wait, everyone! There’s… There’s something\NI want everyone to see. Mizura… What’s that? What’s going on? Is that the effect of the training? How awful. Lord Akahoshi… I take pride in\Nthe Hidden Star Village. Even though it was painful, I endured it and continued\Nthe star training… Even so, were my feelings for\Nthe village still not enough? Mizura! I don’t think there could be lies\Nin that child’s words…and body. Yes. So that’s why\Nthe Third Hoshikage prohibited the star training for a long while. We adults got carried away with\Nour feelings for the village and may have made the wrong choice… You loser! Do you intend to mislead everyone\Nand crush the village?! What’re you doing, Akahoshi?! They aren’t traitors. They’re children of our village! Protect Hokuto and Mizura. Are you going to betray the village?! I can’t go along with your way\Nof doing things, Lord Akahoshi! Me, too. Me, too! Me, too. Me, too. Death to those who betray the village! Execute them all! Are you insane, Akahoshi? If we lost all the children,\Nthere’d be no future for the village! H-Hey…\NYou’re taking things too far, Akahoshi. Take everyone’s feelings into\Nconsideration and yield for now. Shut up!\NWhat’re you doing talking nice now? We’ve long since dirtied our hands. S-Stop! What’re you going to say? Akahoshi, what do you mean? There’s a star in this village that\Nno other villages possess. I just thought we didn’t need\Na foolish village leader who wouldn’t allow the star to be used. What?! Could it be that you are the ones who\Nkilled the Third Hoshikage?! Indeed, there were suspicious rumors\Nconcerning the Third Hoshikage’s death. Akahoshi, prepare yourself\Nand answer! You’ll pay depending on your answer. The three of us assassinated\Nthe Third Hoshikage! It was the quickest way\Nto save the village. Say what?! You guys are the traitors! – Right! 					– Right! Right! No, don’t get the wrong idea. We just helped a little. Idiot. That’ll be an acknowledgement! Akahoshi! We will not acknowledge you\Nas leader of the village. Justice is not with you anymore. It is the children who possess the hearts\Nthat truly care about the village. Everyone! Let us rise together\Nwith those children for the sake of the village. – Yeah! 					– Yeah! We’re sorry, children. We were completely taken in\Nby Akahoshi’s fast-talk. As of now, we’ll fight with you! Give it up, Akahoshi. We’ve lost! Shut up! I haven’t lost. Mizura! Hokuto… Live for me… Mizura! Akahoshi, we won’t let you do as\Nyou please anymore! I won’t let you do something\Nlike go against me! Have you gone mad?! Akahoshi, you’ve lost! Give in to justice with good grace! I won’t lose! The star is now…in my hands! The star?! I will now become\Nthe Fourth Hoshikage! Power… I’m starting to brim\Nwith power. I do not need any training. I could have become one with\Nthe star if I’d done this from the start.. What…What’s this? What’s that?! Byakugan. Massive Chakra from the star has\Npoured into his Chakra Network and is causing it to go out of control. Hokuto! I can’t take it anymore!\NNeji! Hey, Neji! Don’t… Naruto… No matter what you say,\NI’ll kick that Akahoshi jerk’s butt! You jerk. I won’t be responsible. Right. Just say that I butt in on my own. L-Lord Akahoshi. Akahoshi!

We haven’t received complaints\Nfrom the Star Village with regard to the incident of\Nthe star being smashed. In fact, the culprit of this incident was the client Akahoshi,\Nthe deputy Hoshikage. So the mission itself is forgotten! Come to think of it,\Nwhat happened to him? It seems the three, the main culprit Akahoshi and\Naccomplices Yotaka and Shisou, will be punished severely\Nby Hidden Star Village! That’s good! Now the Star Village\Nwill be peaceful. Come in. Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from\Nthe Star Village have been examined. And…? If they all receive proper treatment,\Nthey will return to good health. Hey, what about Mizura? Yes.

Oh, I’m tired… Oh, what a waste! Why?! He had a chance to\Nbecome a Chunin! Shikamaru is Shikamaru… Really… Does he or doesn't he\Nhave the motivation? Even I’m not sure about it. But his intelligence and strategies\Nare no longer at the Genin level. If it had been an actual mission\Nfor a basic platoon, the win was decided when\Nhe captured Temari… So, I suppose he won the competition,\Nbut he lost the match… It’s unfortunate he shows no\Nsigns of being motivated, on the other hand, he won’t get too\Nemotional or fall into a panic. And that’s exactly why… he’d be able to calmly pull back if\Nhe viewed a situation as totally hopeless. That could be attributed to\Ncalm judgment. Shikamaru probably possesses… the most important psychological\Nelement required for a Chunin… the disposition of a leader! In order to evaluate someone\Nas a leader of a platoon… it’s much more important to\Nprotect the platoon from danger, than to carry out a mission. Yeah…it’d hardly be worth mentioning\Na completed mission if everyone was annihilated. The risks and the mission\Nshould be put on a scale, surviving should be thought of first,\Nand then action should be taken. A person who can’t do this isn’t\Nqualified to become a Chunin. Hyuga and Naruto from earlier\Nfail on that point. Although they are all right\Nas insignificant Genin. Well, I do feel like Shikamaru\Ngave up too soon too. What do you think? What do I feel…? He has more of a chance\Nthan Naruto, for sure! Shoot…! Why the heck did he give up! Is he an idiot?! This ticks me off! I’m gonna really give him\Na lecture! So the one that’s gonna\Nbecome a Chunin is… You idiot! Shut up, super idiot! Why the heck did you give up?! Let’s not talk about that anymore,\Nall right? It’s not all right!

I hear Uchiha’s gonna\Nwithdraw from this match. Really?! Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious\Ninjury while training before the match… Are you serious? And to think I took time off\Nspecifically to see this match! I’m counting on you, come on! As you’d expect, this match\Nwill be won by Uchiha. No way, I’ve got high hope\Nfor the new one of the Sand. He won’t let this one slip by. As they say about the world\Nof competition… It’s impossible to predict\Nwhat will occur… Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke, he has not yet arrived at the arena. Umm…it’s unavoidable… We can’t make the guests\Nwait any longer. Another ten minutes. Why don’t we wait just\Nanother ten minutes? But… The guests are looking forward\Nto the next match above all else. Cancelling it would be cruel. Since it’s come to this,\Nwaiting another ten minutes wouldn’t hurt. Lord Hokage…? Umm… Uchiha, where are you! What's keeping you?\NHurry up! There is some truth to what\NKazekage says. So shall we extend it for\Nten minutes from now. So…let Genma know of this. Yes! If it stays like this, Uchiha will really\Nbe forced to withdraw. I see…a ten-minute extension… Sasuke… Hey, isn’t that… Y-You are… But, what’s that idiot doing!\NHe’s still not here?! Sasuke…! Please! Good of the two of you to make it! Come now, hurry into the arena! Yeah! All right! Here we go! Oh! Yeah! Most of the first round is finished, and the only one left is\NSasuke Uchiha and Gaara. H-How about Naruto and\NNeji’s match…?! Well, the interesting thing is… That Hyuga lost… Naruto beat Neji… I see… You did it! Naruto! You’re such a…\Ngood guy really… – What’s going on with the next match!\N– Let's get on with it! Isn’t Uchiha up yet?! We want Uchiha! Uchiha! Uchiha! Hey, it’s almost time. Is he really gonna come?! He’ll come… He’ll definitely come! Oh Sasuke, what’s he doing! What the heck is Uchiha doing?! It seems the rumor that\Nhe’d had a serious injury was true. If there’s a win by default,\Nthen this match is mine. Thirty more seconds… Uchiha! Uchiha! Sasuke…please come! Sasuke! Hurry up and come! It won’t be good if it stays this way! The time limit is up. So this is it. Because the time limit has expired,\Nthe last match… See… Here he is… Well, I’m sorry we’re late… Sasu… Your name?

It’s all right, Sasuke’s match\Nhas been postponed anyway. Your arrival was barely in time, but… he hasn’t been disqualified. That’s good to hear! Don’t lose to a guy like that! Yeah… I want to fight you too… Sasuke! I want…to fight you too! Yeah… Yay, Sasuke! Uchiha's match is gonna start! Shikamaru gave it so much,\Nbut already it’s Sasuke… Poor Shikamaru… Hey, is that Uchiha? I‘m just second fiddle… Well, I guess that’s just\Nthe way it goes… I’m looking forward to it too. Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura. What is? Well, Naruto did beat that\NNeji Hyuga and… Sasuke is an elite member\Nof the Uchiha… and it seems like everyone’s\Nanxious to see Sasuke’s match. Sasuke will face that Gaara\Nof the Sand whom I couldn’t beat… And Naruto beat that Neji\Nthat I had hoped to take down. Why is it so… Why am I so… frustrated! Lee…! At last… Gaara, come down here!

If you were to enter a field of battle\Nwith that frame of mind, you'd die. I-I’m sorry. You got Gaara angry because\Nyou ask stupid questions. You are in trouble. The three of us will conduct\Nhands-on training. Gather in the respective class\Nof your choice. Gaara, put a smile on! They'll get scared and nobody will\Nchoose you with that sulky look. My dad said that Gaara\Nwas the Sand’s ultimate weapon. Yeah. He's so powerful that the village\Nwould be destroyed, if he got mad. He’s scary, so let’s not bother. All right, I’m with Temari. I’ll be with Kankuro! – Me too! 					– Me too! – Me too! 					– Me too! Please be my teacher. Earlier, he was trying to\Nteach me something… Excuse me… Please be my teacher. Are you okay with me? Please teach me! This is cool. That’s too big! I’ll take this. What’s your name? I’m Matsuri. Matsuri, choose a weapon. What’s the matter? Come at me with that weapon\Nwith the intent to kill me. Yes, sir… They say an ogre with Iron Club\Nis invincible. But you are no ogre. Yes, sir. Please tell me\Nwhat I should choose. The weapon called the Rope Javelin. Rope Javelin… The sharp blade on the end of the rope is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,\Nrather than for attack. And you seal off an enemy’s movement\Nwith the rope. Practice until you can control it\Nas a part of your body. Yes, sir! Damn. Who are you guys?! Is this all\Nthe Sand Village Shinobi have? Wait. Leave this guy alive.\NWe can use him to draw that one out. Hang in there! What is it?!\NWhat happened? Take me to Gaara… Quickly. What’s the matter? My mother and father were hit with\Ncountless weapons right in front of me. So I… For what purpose\Ndo you hold a weapon? He… What are… …these two to you?! Th-These guys are… …my friends! Try laying so much as\Nanother finger on them! I’ll clobber you! He said that to me. That’s what we’re after: Gaara. Gaara, we were\Njust coming to get you. The patrol Ninja was\Nattacked by somebody. Guys calling themselves\NThe Four Celestials brandishing strange weapons,\Nsaid to tell Gaara that… ""We declare a challenge to you,\Nthe ultimate weapon. ""If you don’t accept the challenge, ""we will take away one person\Nclose to you every day… ""and they shall\Npay the price for you."" You there. Are you Gaara’s student? You shall be the first sacrifice. What’s this Rope Javelin?! Wait! The enemy went northeast… Matsuri has become a first sacrifice… But the real target of the guys who\Ncall themselves the Four Celestials is… you, Gaara. Yeah… This must be brought to\Na Jonin Council at once… In the northeastern direction where the ones who call themselves\Nthe Four Celestials left, there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves\Nof the Land of Fire, with the Land of Rivers\Nsandwiched between. Therefore, we will be requesting\Nthe assistance of the Leaf… Temari, Kankuro, Gaara. Form a unit and prepare for\Npursuit immediately. Hold it. The enemy is after Gaara. That would be like walking\Nright into a trap they laid. That’s right.\NWhy won’t you send a party?! It might be a diversionary tactic\Nby the enemy. The village will become shorthanded\Nif we send out pursuers. Then you at least could\Ncome with us, right, Baki?! Most likely, the enemy is\Nafter Shukaku. Gaara is the Sand’s ultimate weapon. If we know that… But it's also a dangerous\Ndouble-edged sword to the village. If they would do us the favor\Nfacing each other and perishing… Then at least\NI should go with them. No. You have a different mission. Just send those three! Hey, how about it?! I’ve been given\Na different mission, you see… Go. She’s your student, right? Let’s go, Kankuro. Will it be okay with her?! She’s just a kid. Will he come?! If he doesn’t come, we’ll just sacrifice\Nthose close to him one after another. That is…? It’s a message from the Sand Village! Gaara? Why? Who knows?\NThe goal is a challenge to Gaara. The hostage is a Ninja school student. The enemy is escaping in the direction of\Nthe Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers. Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are\Nchasing after them. At this point, that’s all we know. You want me to set up an operation\Nto stop the overconfident jerks who challenged Gaara\Njust with that information? Yeah. We’re on friendly terms\Nwith the Sand Village, so. Just a minute. They came during the Sasuke incident\Nwith much less information than now. Things are more bothersome\Nthan that time! Our range would widen significantly\Nif we ambushed them instead of pursuing them. There’s also the incident in question\Nin the Village of Artisans, and the Jonin and Chunin\Nare all away… – Shizune… 					– Yes, ma’am! Those are the only Genin\Nwe can use now. Take the Genin you want to use and leave the village\Nwithin thirty minutes! Sakura’s name isn’t on here. Yeah. She’s doing\NMedical Ninjutsu training now, so. I’ll accept the mission.\NBut I have one condition. Please let me borrow Sakura. Sakura? It’s almost time!\Nls this everyone, Shikamaru?! One person still hasn’t come. Could that be…? Sorry to keep you waiting! I can’t do a mission hungry.\NSo I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit. What?! That's not fair just you\Ngetting to eat! I'll also… All right! Now we’ve got\Nall our members together! We’re off! Huh? What? This is it?! I'd heard this was an operation\Nwith a mobilization of the Genin\Nremaining in the village! This is everyone, I tell you! That’s messed up! Setting aside Sakura who’s training, there should still be\NShino, Neji and Hinata! No mistake. It’s weird Akamaru and I\Nbeing the only Ninja with search ability. So is this team\Na go-for-it super attack-type? Yeah. I name us\NTeam Return the Favor. What lame naming! The guys from the Sand Village\Nhelped us during the Sasuke incident! In a manner, this operation will be\Nreturning the favor from that time! All right! Guys, let’s make sure to\Nreturn the favor from that time. You’re not the leader! Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader\Nof this platoon, right?! That’s right… Jeez, then let’s settle on a strategy\Nand get going as soon as possible. Are we going in one line\Nas we did for the Sasuke incident? There’s no doubting the conditions\Nare similar to the Sasuke incident. However, the strategies for pursuit\Nand ambush are completely different! We can’t follow them with Byakugan\Nor by using Akamaru’s nose. No mistake about that. It’s unconventional, but since these are\Nall the people we’ve got, we’ll act in groups of two basis\Nas Two-Man Cells. Solo action is prohibited\Nno matter what the case! We owe a debt to the Ninja in\Nthe Sand Village. However, although this is to repay a debt,\Nno way will we produce casualties! Yeah, I got it. – Follow me, Ino. 					– Right! Choji, you go with Kiba… I’m counting on you, Choji, Akamaru. Right… Lee, you’re with Naruto… Right. Please refrain\Nfrom selfish actions. You don’t need to remind me like that. Also, the four people Naruto mentioned\Nearlier have left before us. Four people, do you mean\NShino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura? Yeah. The four will be\Ngoing their separate ways and won’t take part in future battles! Why not?! Isn’t that an incredible waste\Nof battle strength?! In place of that, we get a wider range\Nof search action… And we’ll have them focus on\Nmedical action in the case of battle starting. I have been entrusted with your lives\Nand this is my strategy! All right, just wait, Gaara! I’ll make sure to return the favor! The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by One of the enemies uses wind, huh?\Nlnteresting. I will be her opponent! Then I’ll take on the guy who brandishes\Nthe sword that looks like a kid’s toy. We’ll take care of this.\NYou go ahead, Gaara. But, will it be okay? We don’t need your help\Nto deal with these chumps. You hurry, Gaara. That girl is\Nyour student, isn’t she?

198,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain Like I said, I've already told you\Neverything I know. You first met Genno at Ichiraku… What did you talk about then? I don’t remember everything! That’s what we want to know. If we analyze your conversation, we might be able to figure out\Nwho hired Genno. We already know all\Nthe conversations that you've had during\Nthe past two weeks. What we want to know is what\Nyou guys talked about before that. You tell me that but…\NI don’t remember… Then we’ll put you\Nunder Regressive Hypnosis. Huh? Regressive Hypnosis? Using hypnosis, we can bring out the memory of\Nthe past from your subconscious… Oh… Just relax… Back to the Past Jutsu! Let’s start… Right now you are traveling\Nthrough your memories… A day ago… two days ago…\Nthree days ago… Keep going back into the past. And…it’s the day you met\Nthe old carpenter. Where are you? Inside…the forest… The Anbu Gives Up?\N                                 Naruto's Recollection\N		I was training on my own…\N		And it was lunch time so… I headed for Ichiraku… And that’s where… You met him not inside\Nthe restaurant, but outside, yes? Hey, what are you doing? Huh? Oh yes… I was just trying to figure out if\NI should go into the restaurant or not. Is it any good? Old man, you’re not from here are you? Oh… I’m a freelance carpenter.\NHow did you know? Because all the Leaf Village people\Nknow that Ichiraku’s ramen is the best! I see… Here you go!\NThanks for waiting! Yes! This is quite good! Isn’t it?! Thank you for this meal! You’re already done? I am a growing boy! Even an extra large isn’t\Nenough for me! I see… Then, why don’t I give\Nyou some of mine. What? Are you sure? Yes. Lucky! Thanks…old man! So…we said good-bye after\Nwe finished eating the ramen… And when did you meet him next? I met him in front of Ichiraku again… Byakugan! There’s nothing here either… I see… Byakugan! I see… It seems like there were\Nodor neutralizing components in last night’s smoke screen. He was quite prepared Then why did he get caught? Well, that’s because our Anbu Black Ops\Nare really good, right…? He should have known that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent\Nbefore he infiltrated us… He should have had\Nother escape routes ready. Now that you mention it,\Nthat sounds about right… But right now,\Nthere’s no way to find out. Dead men tell no tales, I see. Over here. What are you doing? We’re connecting the pieces\Nof the corpse. Connecting the pieces… It was in a really awful shape. From what I hear,\Nhe had Paper Bombs all over his body… Would you like to wait outside\Nuntil we’re done? I-I suppose so… I’ll stay here! What? You’re quite impressive… Sakura. And he gave me eggs and\Nbarbeque pork that time… He’s talking about Ramen again. Shh! Oh, I remember that time…! What happened? He showed…me a photograph. A photograph? A photograph of a guy that\Nlooked about my age. When I asked him why\Nhe was so nice to me… I have a grandson. He’s about the same age as you. So I can’t think of you as a stranger. I look forward to treasure hunting with\Nmy grandson on my days off. Treasure hunting? Yeah… What, you’re already done eating?! Then I’ll give you some of mine. Thanks, old man! What happened to your hand? Oh… It’s a scar from a long time ago when I accidentally cut myself\Nwith a saw. Oh. And then he gave me\Nhis ramen again… Genno has no relatives… Then his story about\Nhis grandson a lie? We started marking him the next day. I think any more inquiries are pointless. I guess he wouldn’t be careless enough to leak any information even to a Gennin. An emergency report\Nfrom Lady Tsunade! I see… There was nothing unusual\Nabout any of the buildings. They were all built\Naccording to their plans… There were no signs of any traps. So was it just camouflage for him\Nto sneak in as a carpenter? It’s too soon to make a judgment on that. If he was just supposed to\Nsteal the plans, there was no need for him\Nto be a carpenter. By the way,\Nwhat were you guys looking up? We got a list of places where\Nhe used to stop by from his carpenter buddies, and we’re looking through\Nall those places, but so far we haven’t found any clues. Oh, there’re a lot of restaurants… Yeah… Seems like he never\Nwent out besides to go eat. In the meantime, Hinata,\Nyou go see Ino and Sakura at the forensics center. Neji and Choji, you guys go\Nhelp Kiba and Shino! Understood. Then, we should get going too… Shikamaru! Lady Tsunade is calling for you! The Fifth Hokage is? What?! The Village Hidden\Nin the Waterfalls? It seems that they’ve committed\Nall their troops into battle position. They’re calling it\Na big practice run, however… Big practice run…? I don’t think I need to say more, but… It’s been used many times in the past.\NThey get all of their troops together for the purpose of a big practice run\Nand then invade another country… Furthermore, there is information that\NGenno stayed in the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls before coming to\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves… It wouldn’t be unusual if there\Nwas some sort of connection. Most of the Ninja we've deployed have already been mobilized\Nto the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. Crossing the border will be\Ntaken as a sign of willful invasion. We will attack anyone that enters. Shikamaru, I want you to\Nhead over to the border, too! I don’t think that there’s\Na need for us to go. Shikamaru?! What do you mean…? Naruto. 					Hey, Naruto! Huh? You’re getting in the way of my business\Nby standing there! Oh… Sorry. Now that I think about it, I’ve never seen the old man finish\Nhis ramen… Could it be that he hated ramen? But then why did he come to\Nlchiraku all the time? Tell us why. Ten Gennin and one Chunin… Our presence or absence won’t\Nmake much of a difference to the overall situation. What is your point…? I don’t like it… Old Man Genno’s actions… After the investigation,\NI’ve figured it out… His everyday activities were\Nquite impressive… His abilities as a carpenter\Nwas average, he was quite plain, never stood out,\Nand never made any big mistakes Nobody hated him,\Nand nobody liked him. Even if he were to disappear\Nall of a sudden, no one would think twice\Nabout it the next day… A very low-key profile. It’s an undercover technique\Nthat's so impressive that I’d want to put it\Nin a Shinobi textbooks. A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked\Nby the Anbu Black Ops so easily… Don't you think that's a bit strange…? That’s true… And when he was trying to get away… He was able to get away from\Nthe Anbu Black Ops, but they caught up to him. For a trap professional,\Nit seems like such a lame end. On top of all that, the plans\Nhave completely disappeared. It doesn’t make any sense to me. And…? Everything is moving\Nalong according to his plan. It couldn’t be…? His true identity being discovered, and dying in front of\Nthe Anbu Black Ops… What if all of that was his plan? And if he had predicted that\Nwe would all leave the village in taking precautions against\Nthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls… We could be just dancing on\Nthe palm of his hand. But if we look at all the information\Nwe have at this point, we need to be on alert for\Nthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. That’s true, but… However… I don’t think the situation will\Nchange much just by sending another ten Gennin\Nand one Chunin… I’ll have the Shikamaru squad\Ncontinue to investigate Genno. Understood. Shikamaru! Choji! Sorry… I didn’t mean to make you wait. My head hurts… Hey. Why do we have to\Nlook through these books? I don’t want to do it either.\NBut this is the basis of investigation. But still… There’re so many numbers,\Nmy eyes are hurting. I’m sorry…\NI still can’t find it . I see… What? The old recommendation letter\Nthat enabled them to figure out that Genno’s\Nrecommendation letter was a fake. Why do you have to look for that? Just a hunch… Did the people of this house just lose it?\NOr did he… In either case, he should have wanted to get rid of the recommendation letter\Nthat he brought… Why would he just get rid of\Nthe old recommendation letter? This is where he took his own life…? It seems that they’ve already\Ncollected the remains. It’s a job done by the Anbu Black Ops… They don’t leave anything behind. Everyone, come over here! Look, the tree is burned on both sides! The Paper Bombs exploded… There should be burned marks. The fact that it’s on both sides\Nis the problem! I see. If it were just a suicide bomb, it wouldn’t have left marks on both sides. There would have to be\Nat least two explosions to leave this kind of burn marks. But according to the Anbu Black Ops, he exploded the Paper Bombs\Nthat were wrapped around his body. But no one saw him at the moment\Nof the explosion… There may be Anbu Black Ops, but they’d still need to dodge\Nthe explosion. This one’s burned on both sides too… Same on this tree too. Probably… First, the Paper Bombs that\Nwere placed on the trees in the surrounding area\Nwere blown up… Then there was a huge explosion\Nin the center. If he had set off the explosions\Nclose to each other, then it’s possible to perceive it\Nas one explosion! I see… But in order to do that, he would have needed to set up\Nsome sort of trick before hand. Didn't Genno take his life after being cornered by\Nthe Anbu Black Ops? What if they didn't catch up to him, but rather,\Nhe let them catch up to him? So you’re saying that\Nhe was running away planning to let them\Ncatch up to him here?! It’s not impossible… If that is the case… It’s possible that he could\Nhave laid other traps Could it be that… the fact he killed himself with\Nthe Paper Bombs is also… It’s done.\NThey said you could come in. Y-Yeah. It’s impossible. Didn’t the Anbu Black Ops make sure\Nwith their own eyes…? Yeah. There's no point in telling me\Nto check out the body. I’m not a Medical Ninja. What should I check\Nand how should I do it…? Sakura… This man… He snuck in as\Na carpenter right? That’s right. Is there something\Nthat bothers you? His hand… It’s too clean. My family owns a flower shop,\Nremember? I’ve been helping out\Nsince I was a kid… So if I look at a person’s hand,\NI can tell what kind of job they do… Carpenter’s hands are much more rough. And there’s no way that a trap\Nprofessional’s hand would be so clean! Then…! May I? Byakugan! Just as I suspected… There’s no evidence that he's trained\Nhis Chakra Network. This man has never controlled\Na Chakra… What? The people from the medical group\Nwere talking over there. That they have some questions\Nabout this body… This person is not a Ninja! Reporting! The spearhead of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls is about to reach the borders! They’re fast…\NWhat about our enforcement army? They are gathering currently, but they’re not in position\Nfor battle quite yet… What if they attack even before\Nwe’re in position for battle? In any case…\NWho would have thought that the Village Hidden in\Nthe Waterfalls would… Nothing will come of that right now. Once the enemy crosses that river, we will see that as their intent\Nto wage war on us, and we will start to attack! Yes! Academy? There were no plans for the Academy… Excuse me!\NCould you help me? Did you call? We saw that the Academy had\Nmade some payments last month… Last month? Oh this. We did some\Nreparation work for the Academy. We don't have the plans for that. No, that’s not possible… That’s strange…\NWhere did I put it? What’s going on? Above…? What’s the matter, Naruto? What’s going on? They should show themselves soon… Reporting! The Village Hidden\Nin the Waterfalls spearhead that was closing in on the borders\Nhas started to retreat! What?! It seems like it really was\Na practice run… Then where are the stolen plans?! Th-This is… This is Shikamaru’s… These are the plans? Yeah… It’s written in a complex code\Nso that it’s not easily deciphered. But… Why are the plans that were stolen\Nby Genno appearing here?

And…quite a bit of time’s\Npassed since then… but things are still kind of awkward\Nbetween him and Father. Good morning, Father… Yeah, good morning. Sasuke… how have things\Nbeen going at the Academy lately? It’s boring with just school classes. I’m always number one, so… Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! W-Wow… This is the fundamental\NJutsu of the Uchiha. The Sign is as I taught you earlier. You build up Chakra, stop it once at around between\Nthe mouth and the chest area, and spew it out at once after that. Try it. Okay! Father…is teaching me Jutsu himself. Finally… Father has also recognized me! I must live up to his expectations! I too can…! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Sure enough, it won’t go like\Nit did with Itachi, huh? It might’ve still been\Ntoo soon for you. A member of the Uchiha Clan\Nis not recognized as full-fledged until they can use the Fire Style.

Today for sure! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Sasuke…! Wait a minute. What is it? What…? Oh… Don’t move. Okay, finished! Mother… Hmm? No… It’s nothing. Okay… Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! Sure enough, it won’t go\Nlike it did with Itachi, huh? It might’ve still been\Ntoo soon for you… I’m just, getting started.\NDamn it! One more time!

Even if I were to teach you\Nfor only after a week… It’s not that… I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu. So I want you to see it. Failure is not an option! Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu! That’s my boy.

Mother…? Hmm? What does Father really think of\NBig Brother and me? What is it all of a sudden? The other day, Father said to me,\N“That’s my boy.” He’d always said that only\Nto Big Brother. So I was really happy. I see…Good for you. But lately, Father and Brother\Nhaven’t been getting along, so… I was thinking… that I might just be\Na replacement for Big Brother. Your older brother’s your older brother.\NAnd you are you. Your father cares deeply\Nabout you both. Then why does he only think\Nabout Big Brother?! That’s not it… Your father has to protect\Nthe Uchiha Clan as a representative of the clan. What about it?! Itachi is just bigger than you\Nand is your elder. He’ll naturally be entrusted with that much more work\Nfor the clan, right? Your father is the supervisor\Nof the work, so… it might be that his eyes were\Nlikely to go towards your older brother. But, this is just between us. When he’s with me, your father does nothing\Nbut talk about you. He’s just always sullen\Nand awkward, so… I’ll catch up to Big Brother\Nno matter what! Damn it…! Big Brother’s back is still\Nfar out of reach. Forgive me, Sasuke…\NMaybe another time. Clan…Clan… You measure incorrectly\Nthe size of your own “vessels” and don’t know the depth of mine,\Nso you grovel there. My “vessel” is\Ndismayed at this foolish clan. I feel like…ever since that day, he hasn’t been the same\Nas he was before. Big Brother… Today, when school’s finished, will you join me for\Nsome Shuriken Jutsu training? I’m busy.\NYou should have Father teach you. But even I know that you’re better\Nat Shuriken Jutsu than Father is. You always treat me like\Na nuisance like that. Forgive me, Sasuke.\NMaybe next time… I don’t have the time to\Nbe dealing with you today. You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,”\Nand poke me on the forehead. and you say “today,”\Nbut it never happens. Thank goodness…\Nhe’s the same as before. Big Brother… His eyes looking back\Nat Father that time… It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan… And… Father…? Hmm? Are there several types\Nof Sharingan? Oh…You’re already interested\Nin Sharingan? However, it's still too soon for you. It’s totally different from\Nthe Fire Style Jutsu. But someday, I too…! After all… I’m your kid, so. Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu\Nabove the Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan. Mangekyo Sharingan… In the long history of the Uchiha, it’s a legendary Visual Jutsu\Nthat only a few develop. And it’s said that it only opened\Nunder a particular condition. A particular condition…? Don’t chase after your\Nolder brother anymore. I wonder what he thinks of my\Nrelationship with Brother? Father… Why doesn’t Big Brother care\Nabout me? He’s a bit peculiar… He’s a type of person who doesn’t\Ncare for making friends with people. Why? Who knows…? Even I, his father, can’t read that boy. Here I spoke because I wanted\Nmore of Big Brother’s attention. Father isn’t against it. Here, Sasuke!\NYour box lunch. I’ll watch your Shuriken practice\Nafter you come home. It’s not practice, it’s training! I’m off! That’s good… It’s not that Father dislikes\NBig Brother, after all. Big Brother graduated from the Academy\Nat the top of his class at age seven. He learned to use\Nthe Sharingan at age eight. And he was promoted\Nto Chunin at age ten. But, I’ve got the same Uchiha blood\Nflowing inside me as he does. I won’t lose to him! You’re not gonna tell me this is\Nthe best you can do, are you? You boast about your Way of Ninja\Nand this is all you've got? Are you still thinking that\NI’m a member of your comrade game? If that’s the case, you're… a hopeless fool! Stop wasting time! Give me all you’ve got, you number one hyperactive,\Nknucklehead Ninja! When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… Just as Neji said, it seems Sasuke’s in\Nthe darkness right now. Damn it. He really did hit me with\Nall his might. Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade\Nor anything anymore?! Don’t all those things we\Ndid together in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!

160,"I want to try and gather\Nthe unrestrained winds I’ll run toward the horizon,\Nalongside the wave crests I’ve made my decision, even if there’s a long way to go\Non that road. I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? Hmm, what? A wanted flyer. ""This man who calls himself\NTokichi is a major criminal who has killed a family of three…"" ""He has a bird-shaped birthmark\Non his chest."" A bird-shaped birthmark…?\Nlt couldn’t be… What is it, Hinata? I can’t tell because\Nhis face is covered with scars. But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark. He has a bounty on his head too? What the heck is going on\Nwith everything? Hunt or Be Hunted?!\N                     Showdown at the OK Temple Where are you going, old man? Just rest quietly. Let go! Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine… What the heck can you do in that condition,\Nyou wanted man?! A bounty hunter who was\Nin the bar attacked last night… What’s the idea of a bounty\Nchasing after a bounty? It’s none of your concern! Your wound again… Stop! D-Don’t move! I didn’t do it… Then, how do you explain\Nthis wanted flyer? That Gosunkugi did it… He killed an innocent family\Nof three… just to steal money. What do you mean by that? I was a swordsmith in a tiny village… in a small country sandwiched\Nbetween two large countries. I was poor,\Nbut for me it was a happy life. But on that festival day… I was about to go deliver a sword\Nthat a customer had ordered. I wanted to participate in the festival\Nright away, so I was hurrying. At that very moment… For some reason,\Nthe door was half open. It’s Tokichi…\NI’m delivering the sword you ordered… I told everyone everything\Nas it happened. But…the people in the village\Nwouldn’t believe me. It’s because I was the only one\Nwho hadn’t shown up at the festival. And the particular shape of the sword\Nthat stabbed through the family… A swordsmith should be able\Nto make any kind of weapon… That was the reason. Stand up, Tokichi! Tokichi! Don’t let him get away! After him! And ever since… I wandered aimlessly from town to town. BOUNTY \NOne million ryo It was something\Nthe villagers had issued. And there was one more\Nwanted flyer besides mine… BOUNTY 					Threee million yen …of the man who killed the family. I resolved to capture Gosunkugi\Nwith my own hands. I would clear my name and\Nreturn to my village… And…to get some information about him,\Nif even just a little… I became a bounty hunter despite\Nhaving a price on my own head. So that’s why we were in the way, huh? The only way to prove my innocence\Nis for me to capture him myself. I want to go home. Will you…concede him to me? We’re Ninja. We carry out missions we’ve received,\Nno matter what! Even if the worst were to happen,\Nwe can’t let him get away. Let’s go… Was that okay, Naruto? That Gosunkugi jerk! We have to capture him,\Nno matter what. That’s right. And if that old man, Sazanami,\Npushes it too far in his condition, not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi,\Nhe could end up getting killed instead. Don’t hold back.\NI’ll give you… the likes of my head. You’re wounded,\Nso I can kill you whenever I want. Before that, I’ll be taking Gosunkugi. Well, I guess I’ll just have\Nthose Shinobi kids do their best. The Land of Stone,\NPost Station Two… It seems everything in this town… politics, economics, military,\Nis conducted by monks. It really is. Nothing but temples… The temple, which could be\Ncalled the head temple, is the OK Temple on that mountain. Hey, Hinata. What’s that bell? That was created as\Nthe sightseeing crown jewel to recruit people to live in their temple…\NThe Golden Bell! It’s just like it is saying,\N“Please steal me.” I know…\NGosunkugi is after that bell! – Yeah. 					– Yeah. But how does that Gosunkugi guy\Nintend to steal that bell? Naruto! Huh…? You guys…are Gosunkugi’s…! Are these guys going to corral us?! Just like the time with Sazanami… Byakugan. Look out! Run! Old Man Sazanami?! Leave this to me! All right! Eat this! What’re you doing here…? I just came to settle the score. But…your wound is still… I won’t get in your way. I’ll pursue the target on my own.\NThis is a competition! I guess it can’t be helped.\NI accept! But we can’t even start\Nas things stand now! There are still nails in the ground… He’s waiting for the best moment. Gosunkugi! The bell…is at the top! What…?! Could it be…?! Oh, no…! The nails in the ground aren’t moving. The Jutsu has worn off! What?! Damn it! When did he--?! So as the words say,\Nwe’ve been “nailed down,” huh? They're by the bell! Why that--! Wait! Don’t forget the bounty hunter\Nfrom last night is also after Gosunkugi! No problem…! We’ll get there first,\Nno matter what! Let’s go! How awful… That Gosunkugi jerk…! Unforgivable! Hey! Where’s Gosunkugi?! Naruto! He’ll get away if we’re too slow! We don’t have any time to think.\NLet’s take care of this in one shot! Gentle Fist! Akamaru! Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry… Man-Beast Clone! Fang Over Fang! Shadow Clone Jutsu! U-zu-ma-ki Naruto Barrage! Here I go… I hit you with the back of the sword… Where’s Gosunkugi? That way! Gosunkugi! He’s ours! Old man, you’re going to prove\Nyour innocence, right?! If you’re a bounty hunter,\Nthen show your pride! Ninja Art: Flying Nail Mist! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Eat this! Too slow! Farewell! Damn it…! It’s not over yet! What?! Prepare yourself! W-Wait! Don’t be hasty… If I kill you, the one who can prove\Nmy innocence will be gone! We lose… That’s right… What?! Bounty Sazanami,\Notherwise known as Tokichi… I, Gatsu, have apprehended you! And you, bounty Gosunkugi! Your spree of evil deeds… The number of charges\Nagainst you is incalculable… A government official has ordered\Nyou hauled in for questioning! Old man… Damn it. There’s nothing we can do\Nif the opposition is a bureaucrat… You murderer! Give back the family you killed! We’ll kill you in the same way! Damn it…! Hey, hey, you guys! You’ve got nerve to put up wanted flyers\Nwithout doing a decent investigation! This man is the true culprit behind\Nthe murder that occurred in this village! This Gosunkugi has already been\Napprehended and has confessed. And the weapon has been seized… Therefore this individual Tokichi\Nshall be acquitted! You jerks!\NYou made me work for free! What’re you going to do about it?! Why’d you do that for me? I overheard some stupid tale\Nof woe, you see. It makes no difference\Nto a bounty hunter… But I overheard it,\Nand so I had no choice. It was necessary to verify whether\Nor not you really are a wanted man… You… Not “you.” Gatsu! I’m also a bounty hunter…\NI’m in the same trade as you! Gatsu… Tokichi… We’re sorry. Forgive us, Tokichi. Good for you… Old Man Sazanami. Let’s go. I’ve kind of gotten homesick and\Nreally miss the Leaf Village… But you know, a failed mission\Nmeans failure… The Fifth Hokage’s going\Nto scold you good, Naruto. What?! You failed another mission?!

Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something Blaze Away, Byakugan!\NThis is My Ninja Way!! Kiba! Naruto! This isn’t good. Oh my, what’s wrong? So you’ll just stay there\Nand become larvae food? Queen Bee… That kind of stuff shouldn’t\Nbe effective, should it?! Chakra…! Byakugan! It’s no good… There’s no way\NI can make it in time! Naruto… I don’t know when to give up! That’s right… I know that Naruto would never give up,\Nno matter what the situation is! Hey, did you catch them? What a foolish group! They made this creature mad… And they all got bound in wax! Bees make wax. You’re an insect handler\Nand you don’t know that? He’s right!\NC’mon, are you really an insect handler? What about the Bikochu? Nothing. We did an all-out mobilization\Nand searched, but we haven’t found it. Aren’t these guys carrying it? That’s unthinkable. So that means… So we’re going to have to\Nask one of these guys, after all. Who’s gonna talk?! We can tell you. Shino! However…\Nlt’s in exchange for Hinata. That’s stupid, isn’t it? To bargain… Do you not understand your position? You guys definitely will not\Nfind the Bikochu. And you’re pressed for time. You are the ones…who will regret it. What should we do? If things stay like this, the Bikochu won’t be of any help\Neven if it hatches. In that case, our mission is also… But… If we can get rid of even one\Nof the Aburame family… Hinata… Are you worried? Of course! She’s strong. Huh? Much more…than you think. I concede. We have a deal. First of all, we need our friend. What happened? The brat…isn’t here. The wax she was trapped in isn’t there.… She may have been swept out\Nto the waterfall. Jibachi! It can’t be helped! I warned her not\Nto make a bad move or she’d die. You! What did you do to Hinata?! What happened to Hinata! Hey! Shut up, kid. The kid’s probably in\Nthe depths of hell about now. Damn you! Aha, the girl’s your girlfriend? You…! I absolutely will not forgive you! You’re kidding me.\NWhat can you do looking like that? Without Hinata you’ll never get\Nyour hands on the Bikochu either. You are right… That girl’s death was not part\Nof the plan, but in the end, it’s a good thing. Because…we’ll take your lives in return. From the very beginning, people from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves and from my own Village Hidden in the Stones\Nhave been sworn enemies. It’s natural that we kill\Neach other, isn’t it? What're ya gonna do, little guy? Die like this? Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is,\NI could save you for now. – All right.\N– Don’t you dare tell them! Those jerks,\NI’m going to blow them away! Shut up, brat! – Jibachi? 					– Hey! Shut up, I’ve got to kill him! It’s a Paper Bomb! You’re…! Y-You’re…! …still alive! That was really close.\NBut I didn’t give up, just like Naruto… Did she escape from the wax?\Nlt can’t be! These are not ordinary kids. Leave it to me! Hinata! I’ve never used that in an actual fight… But I have to do it here, now! Bee Bombs Jutsu! 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu! Bee Swarm Jutsu! Naruto… Naruto… Watch me. Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms! – What?! 					– What?! You’re kidding, right? That Hinata can do\Nsuch an amazing Jutsu? The Hinata that you know, Naruto,\Nis from when? What do you mean? You’ve learned new Jutsu\Nsince the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven’t you? Hinata has been steadily developing, too. She always has been concerned… Take aim. That’s nice, the three of you, all have something you’re good at\Nand something you like. Hinata, you should find something, too… You’re right. By the way, what is it? You had some business with me,\Ndidn’t you? Yeah… I want you to join me\Nin my training. Hinata was fretting over\Nwhat she could do… What she should do… Hinata! Hey, I don’t think that we should… No… Don’t go easy on me! If you’re doing it for me… Do it seriously! I’ve got it! During the harsh training, Hinata discovered her own styles…\Nand her own special Jutsu. That’s the result of her training. Huh? You, why!? I’ll tell you something… Angering the Queen Bee,\Ngetting encased in wax, it was all part of the strategy. With our Chakra being sucked\Nand being immobilized, it was the only way to protect ourselves\Nfrom the larvae… And, do you think I was doing nothing\Nwhile I was captured? I was ordering my bugs.\NThe wax we’re wrapped in is very weak. Shino! Because of her hard training, Hinata’s Chakra control\Nhas dramatically improved. That Jutsu is what she developed\Nfrom the training… Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms! Hinata’s already flexible body combined\Nwith fine-tuned Chakra control could completely defend\Nan attack from every direction… Truly, it’s an ultimate defense Jutsu. Yet it’s different from\NNeji’s 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation. It’s Hinata’s own Jutsu… She finally worked that out on her own. She probably did it because she wanted\Nto be acknowledged by her father. To be acknowledged by everyone… And to be acknowledged by you. Our Jutsu isn’t effective at all?! What the hell is going on? What a girl! Hey, what happened to those guys?! When did they?! Summoning Jutsu! Blow them away! Hinata! Shino! Believe…in her. Make the Chakra… sharper, stronger… bigger, more flexible… more…more…more…\Nmore…more…more…more! Hinata! Hinata! Naruto… Hinata, that’s an awesome Jutsu!\NYou’re really awesome! Naruto…! Let’s hurry. It’ll be dawn soon. – Okay! 					– Yeah! Oh, it’s becoming a pupa already? If we make it smell Sasuke’s scent\Nat the moment it hatches, the mission is complete. Right! Sasuke… Wait for me! No way! Inside the tree, huh. If it was there,\Nthe bees should have found it… You can still move? This insect cage was coated\Nwith secret Aburame family insect repellent. Wh-What? The bees won’t come close\Nbecause of the repellent. As long as you’re using bees to search…\Nyou definitely won’t find it. I expected as much. I think as long as your clan exists… my clan maybe destined to\Nbe ruined some day. But! I absolutely will not let you\Nsucceed at your mission! Even if it kills me, that Bikochu… Shadow Clone Jutsu! This is our hope…\Nin order to get our friend back! I won’t let you do that! Shut up! Rasengan! Hey, look… The pupa is hatching! Okay! Huh? It's gone! You had it ‘til just a minute ago! Hey, search for it, hurry! R-Right… Byakugan! Naruto! Over there. You blew it away the instant you set off\Nthe Rasengan! Hurry! I know! C’mon, c’mon. It’s going to hatch! We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this… Wh-Why…?! That thing just now doesn’t count!\NC’mon, sniff Sasuke’s smell! It’s all over now. Huh…? Hey! Stop! Wait! So you failed because you farted! Take responsibility! What are you saying that for?! Well then… That’s…the Bikochu, isn’t it? Naruto… I found you! C’mon, forgive me already, Sakura! No! I absolutely will not forgive you! – Sakura, you look so scary!\N– Come back here! So the mission failed… It seems that they succeeded\Nat protecting the Bikochu, but failed at getting it to smell\Nthe scent of Sasuke Uchiha. I see… Hinata must be depressed. This strategy was her idea, wasn’t it? Well… Looks like that’s not the case. Hinata… I heard that your mission failed. Yes. It didn’t work at all. I have to train more and more…\Nand work harder next time! I-I see… Good luck. More… More… More… More! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah What! Why do I have to go on\Nsuch an easy mission?! Don’t complain! You’re the one\Nwho picked up this mission’s client! That’s no reason!\NAfter all, I’m busy with a lot stuff!

Okay… Goodbye, Iruka Sensei! It looks like he got over it. Hey, Lee! On your way back from rehabilitation? Um…yes… I hope you get better soon. Thank you very much. To activate each and\Nevery cell all at once… If it were just one by one,\Nit’d be a snap, but all of them together\Nis gonna be tough. Still… The Leaf Village is\Nin great trouble right now, so we must do our best! I think if you had Lady Tsunade take\Na look, you'd get better very quickly. It's better that you give up being\Na Shinobi and look for a different path. Sensei and Student:\NThe Bond of the Shinobi Clone Jutsu! Transformation Jutsu! Hey, young kid… The medal of youth is one of passion,\Nwith no looking back! If you work hard at it, I’m telling you, son,\Nyou will become a fine Shinobi! Yay! Who is he?\NHe is pretty overbearing. Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth… Well then, adieu. That was the first time I met Guy Sensei. And then… Today, you have all become Genin. I want to hear what\Nyour goals are for the future. I don’t want to answer. I-I…! I'd like to prove that\NI could become a splendid Ninja, even though I can’t use\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu! That would be the ultimate for me! Those are good serious eyes… You! What's so funny?! I'm serious! I will become a respectable Ninja\Neven only with Taijutsu! Don’t you realize that\Nif you can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu, you’re not a Ninja in the first place? Don’t you remember being told\Nthat you’re the first person to graduate from the academy\Nwho’s only able to use Taijutsu ? It’s not because you’re so good;\Nit’s just that you’re unusual. W-Why--! Listen up! If you have passion,\Nit’s not necessarily so. If you act with passion, compete with good rivals\Nand lift each other up, you can all become great Ninja! But you know,\Nyou have to work hard! Passion… I…was inspired by Guy Sensei. By his words…and his deeds. You’re late!\N17 minutes and 32 seconds late! Let’s not do it today, all right? Each of us has 48 wins! With a win today,\None of us will pull ahead! I guess you won't give up\Neven if I say I wouldn’t want to do it. It’s my turn to choose the event, right? Right! What’s it gonna be? A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash? Holding our breath under water? I don’t care, we could even\Nhave an eating contest… Please… Okay, then… Wh-What?! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors?\NThat’s what you choose? They say that your luck is\None part of your skill, don’t they? Plus, it’s a great competition\Nfor testing your observational reflexes… R-Right. Do you get the feeling\NKakashi’s just playing around with Guy ‘cuz he can't be bothered? That’s what it looks like to me. I accept the battle.\NThere’s no way I’m gonna lose! If I do, I’ll walk around the Leaf Village\N500 times on my hands! There you go again… I promise! Here we go… Another one of your special,\Nself-imposed rules. He can’t do that. That’s ridiculous.\NHe’s acting like a kid. Yeah, that’s impossible,\Neven for Guy Sensei. Impossible? Reckless, I’d say! – Rock, paper…!\N– Rock, paper…! Here you are. Guy Sensei? How did you know I was here? I know everything about you. I heard that you skipped out\Non rehabilitation these past two days? You can’t be doing that! When I first became Genin… this is where I revealed\Nmy dream, my aspiration. Neji laughed at me then,\Nbut I meant what I said. I'd like to prove that\NI could become a splendid Ninja even though I can't use\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu! That would be the ultimate for me! At that time, you told me… If you act with passion,\Ncompete with rivals, you can become a fine Ninja. And that… In order to do that, it’d take “effort.” I was happy to hear that. – Transform! 					– Transform! Because while at the academy… no one, not one friend or teacher,\Nsaid that kind of thing to me. You put me at ease… You opened up a path\Njust when I was unsure of myself. I realized all I had to do\Nwas try my best. And when I complained that all my efforts couldn’t match\Nthe others’ natural talents, you told me that I had\Na natural talent for effort. That was when I learned the importance\Nof believing in my own strength. The chance of a successful surgery\Nis probably 50%, at best. But…this is one time…\Neven if I try my best…! and even if I believe in myself,\Nthere’s nothing in the world I can do! Guy Sensei… Please tell me…! Please tell me.\NCan I become like you? Why did this kind of thing\Nhappen only to me? Because I have my own\NWay of Ninja to follow, my own dreams and aspirations\Nthat I have to protect and prove to the world even\Nif it means dying for… What should I do?! The Eight Inner Gates… Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that\Nwill destroy the body of the practitioner? Please tell me! I’m prepared for the worst. Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu! Everything is…for my dream! That means everything to me! You tried to become a great Ninja\Nrelying only on Taijutsu… Until now, that’s all you had. It must be so painful for you… Now that it seems that your dreams and all your wishes\Nare being cruelly taken away. It does not matter what his wishes are,\Nhe should give up on becoming a Shinobi. Lee… If you want to be free of that pain,\Nyou have to prepare yourself! Does it mean…\Nto prepare to give up my dreams? If you lose your dreams, you will undergo pain even greater\Nthan what you feel now. Neither you nor I would be able to\Ngo on living if we lose the Way of Ninja. What fools we are… Lee! Have the surgery! How’s it going with Cell Activation Jutsu? It’s all about the Chakra, but… There are so many kinds of cells… skin cells, internal organ cells,\Nmuscular cells… You know, it’s just a tad difficult\Nto activate all of them at once. What’s that?\N“Just a tad,” you say? Are you testing me? Oh no! I’m declaring my trust in you. I don’t know why,\Nbut just a while ago… I was remembering the time\Nwhen you and Kakashi Sensei were competing\Nwith rock, paper, scissors. At that time, Kakashi Sensei said that your luck is\None part of your skill, right? This surgery is also fifty-fifty,\Nlive or die… But… it’s not a game of\Nrock, paper, scissors! Do you remember what happened\Nafter that, Lee? 500 times around…\Nlt’s a promise! Yay! What's he doing?! Shoot! If I lose, I’ll walk 500 times\Naround the Leaf Village, on my hands! It's a promise! He can’t do that! That’s stupid.\NHe’s acting like a kid. Hah! This is nothing! Wh-What are you doing here, Lee? Why are you doing this? Kakashi Sensei is not here.\Nln fact, no one is watching. When a man stands cool with\Na Nice-guy pose in front of others, he should keep his promise,\Neven if it kills him! It’s a promise! What? Why do you always do that? Whenever you’re about to start\Ndoing something, why do you always come up\Nwith some kind of crazy rule. Good question, Lee. You really know how\Nto get to the point. OK, I’ll tell you.\NBut remember, you can’t tell anyone else. What’s the answer? Making self-rules is nothing less than\Na practice which brings me victory! S-Self-rules…? Are you ready? The point of these rules is that,\Nwhen you’re going after something, they push you into a real tough spot… It’s about chaining yourself down. For example, on the other side\Nof the hellish rule that “If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,\NI’ll do 500 laps” is the idea that “If I do 500 laps, there’s no way I won’t be able\Nto beat Kakashi next time.” They hold power,\Nthe potential of the heavens. Y-Yes… By being chained down\Nto doing 500 laps, it makes you get serious. Even about things like\Nrock, paper, scissors competitions, which are so trifling otherwise. And, even if you lose,\Nwalking around the village 500 times give you the benefit\Nof extremely intense training. I see! OK, I’ve gotta do a little more.\NHere we go! I’m going with you!\NI have my own “self-rule” which is-- Hey! Hey! Don’t push yourself, Lee. If I can’t keep up with you, I'll… try even harder! That is, I’ll aim to be like you. And if I keep trying,\NI’ll be able to become a great Ninja! All right! If that’s the case,\Nthen I have an addition to my rule!

And the next match. This year’s rookie looks challenging… Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka It’s here, it’s here, it’s here! What we’ve been waiting for! It’s finally my turn! Yeah! Lucky us! If it’s this guy,\Nwe’ll absolutely win, Akamaru! Show us how much you’ve grown. I’m going to do it! Akamaru Unleashed!\NWho's Top Dog Now? The seventh battle,\NNaruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka. I got sick of waiting! It’s finally time for me to shine!\NBelieve it! That’s my line! With you as my opponent,\NI’ve as good as won! Right, Akamaru? Don’t get excited! You won’t be able to beat me! Why you little…! Hey! Don’t bring your puppy! He’ll get in the way of the match! You fool! Akamaru’s going to fight with me. Hey, hey! Is that okay? Yes. Animals and insects are treated\Nthe same as ninja tools. There’s no problem. Well, that’s fine! It’s a perfect handicap! Talking tough! Then… Akamaru, don’t put a paw in this. I’ll fight him by myself! Naruto! Don’t lose to a guy like this! It’s finally come. Naruto, huh? I’m sorry, but he can’t beat Kiba... Kakashi. Naruto... I-I want to support you, but… Kiba’s on my team… Kiba will get mad… But… Naruto… Kiba’s lucky. Hah! Hah! I don’t know how strong he’s become\Nsince this guy became a Genin… Today we’ll run through Transformation Jutsu. You’ll change yourself into Lord Hokage… His ability was “that,” so… Transform! So noisy... I was sleeping comfortably… T-That was a joke!\NI-I did it on purpose! Enough, Naruto! It’s your third year\Nat the academy! Wha--? Goodness sake, who is that guy? We’ve just switched to this class\Nand already found someone funny. That guy, he’s on a roll. He’s an attention-seeker, huh? One more time, fool! Transform! You… Is it possible…? Hey hey, are you serious? You’ve been here for three years and\Ncan’t even do a respectable transformation? All of you watch now! I will absolutely someday become\N the true and a real Hokage! Lame! What Hokage?! Some sympathy at the very least… I’ll do you in, in one clean blow! Really? But you can’t beat me! I said not to act tough. Well then. Please begin! Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:\NAll-Four Jutsu! Here I come! Fast! It will be a while ‘til\Nhe opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor. Just as I thought. That Naruto can’t be equal to Kiba. Naruto… That was too embarrassing to watch. See… What was that?\NThat guy is weak. Naruto! Huh? Yes, that’s it… I’ll surpass Hokage! Then everyone in the village will\Nacknowledge my existence! Those are his words… I’ve always made fun of them, too. This is the Jonin…a true Ninja… I have to escape… If I stay like this… I’ll really, really be killed! Are you hurt… Scaredy cat? You just need to become\Nstronger than me! Darn you! You! What are you doing all of a sudden?! T-This stupid coward is...\Nabsolutely... not the Sasuke I know! Don’t mess with me! W-What? But, it was wrong! Hey... are you hurt? Scaredy cat? I won’t change my words,\Nthat’s my way of Ninja! Naruto... Say it to everyone! Don't... Don't... underestimate me! Yeah! He seems to have grown\Nto say such thing. Naruto…! Go, Naruto! What are you talking about,\Nbleeding like that? Your tough talk has gone too far! I didn’t use my power fully…\Nto observe your strength first! You too, cut out the tough talk\Nand use the dog or whatever you want! You’ll regret this… Let’s go Akamaru! Smoke Ball? Take this! I can’t see! This is bad! I have to get out of the smoke…\Nor I’ll be done for. It worked! What is it…? Shoot…I can’t see anything. Yeah! We did it! Yay! Good job, Akama--! A-Akamaru… Why? Why? You took the bait! Y-You! Transform Jutsu?! Ouch! Shoot! Let go! You smell like a dog! W-Where’s Akamaru?! Over here! Akamaru! Darn! No way! That's Naruto?! An equal match with Kiba… No, it may be more than equal! Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu\Nto Transform Jutsu, that’s a clever trick. Naruto shouldn’t be able to do that… His timing at using Jutsu’s is very good. What? He’s better than I thought. But, to get mad like that after\Nbiting the opponent himself… What a funny guy. N-Naruto…amazing! That’s amazing, Naruto! You got a little bit stronger. But it’s over. Next, I’ll attack you seriously. Oh really?! But you will absolutely not beat me! During this exam,\Nhe’s matured again. This is a surprise… That’s Naruto, the perpetual goof…? Evidently it’s no longer “that” Naruto. Yeah. I wonder, what kind\Nof trick Kakashi used…? Still… Huh? As for the development of\Nmy Kiba and Akamaru, it's probably more than Naruto. Naruto…I’ll take Akamaru... back! W-What's this?! What did you feed him?\NHis fur turned red! That’s why he’s called “Akamaru”, red boy. Food Pills huh…? That Kiba… He intends to end it with this. Here we go, Akamaru! Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…! Man Beast Clones! T-There’s something wrong\Nwith their eyes! He’s using some weird drug! Isn’t this doping? Is this okay?! Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools. You, that’s all you say! What?! What did that guy eat? It’s Food Pills. F-Food Pills? Food Pills are a secret medicine\Nthat people in the military take and fight for three days and\Nthree nights without a break… They’re high in protein,\Neasily absorbed and have some types of component\Nthat influence agitation or sedation… Kiba and Akamaru’s Chakra must\Nbe doubled right now… It’s over with this… Let’s go! All-Four... Jutsu! N-Naruto! That Naruto is in danger! Kiba’s the gung-ho fighter type\Nwho will attack like a beast with Chakra wired\Nthroughout his body. And the Food Pills that double one’s\NChakra are quite simply… the perfect pill for Kiba. Naruto… This isn’t good… There’s no way to counterattack… All I can do is gather all\Nthe Chakra in my legs and do my best to escape…! At this rate… Here’s my chance! Take this! Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique! Fang Over Fang! This is the difference in\Nour true powers. I'm going... to become the Hokage. I can’t lose here...! You? Hokage?! When you’re weaker than me? I’ll become Hokage for you! You know deep down inside\Nthat you can’t become the Hokage. So quit acting tough! You’re wrong, Kiba… Naruto... He’s not that weak… I’ll receive the name...\Nof Lord Hokage! All of you, just watch! Naruto, unlike me... he has always believed in his own worth. I thought it was really amazing… It must have been really hard… I understand that. And yet before not even one person… tried to see Naruto. Hey, that’s the kid… I heard he’s the only one...\Nwho failed. Humph! Serves him right! It’s trouble if a kid like that\Nbecomes a Ninja. After all, that kid is really… Stop! Anything further is taboo. Nobody tried to acknowledge\Nreal Naruto. Clone Jutsu! But now… Everyone’s watching… Stand up! Naruto! Everyone is acknowledging him! If you compete with me for\Nthe name of Hokage… You…will be the loser! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

25,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart I think we almost finished\Nshaking off the losers. Then I guess I'll move\Nonto the main issue. It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start. All right! Here is the tenth question! Here it comes! I have to put everything on\Nthe line for this question! The Tenth Question: All or Nothing! Hmph! Making such a big deal. This is the final obstacle. Kankuro, come back already! If he starts the tenth question,\Nyour cheat sheet has no meaning! But before that, I'm going to add\Nsome rules for the last question. Aren't you lucky? It looks like playing with\Nthe dolls wasn't a waste, after all? This guy. He's figured Crow out! Anyway, sit down. Let me explain! These are the hopeless rules! Well, anyhow. There's nothing to do when\Nthe subordinates are gone, huh? Well, it'll get busy soon enough. Why? This year's first proctor... I hear it's that Ibiki Morino. Well then, passing the first exam\Nalready seems iffy. Of all the people, that sadist... Sadist? Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,\N so you wouldn't know. Who is this person? He is a pro, a professional. Professional? Of what? Torture and interrogation. What?! Well, there maybe no physical torture\Nin the exam itself, but he's sure to use his\Nhis skills as an interrogator to torment them psychologically. That is... Leaf Village Anbu's\NTorture and Interrogation Unit Marshall, Ibiki Morino! Hopeless rules...?! First, you guys will have to choose whether or not you will take\Nthis 10th question! Huh?! Choose whether or not\Nto take the exam? What, choose?! What happens if you choose not\Nto take the 10th exam? If you chose not to take the exam,\Nthen your score will be zero. In other words, you fail! And of course, the same goes for\Nthe two others in the same group! W-What does that mean! Of course, everybody is going to\Nchoose to take the exam! This is ridiculous!\NAs if we have a choice! And... one more rule... Another one?! Finish with it already! If you chose to take it and\Nare unable to answer it correctly, then you will have to... relinquish your right\Nof taking the Chunin Exam forever. What kind of ridiculous rule is that?! Besides, there are plenty\Nof people here who have taken the\NChunin Exam many times! You're just unlucky. I make the rule this year. But I did give you\Nthe option to go back! For those of you who aren't confident,\Nyou can choose not to take it and take the exam\Nnext year or the year after that. Oh! How terrible! If one out of the three\Nchooses not to take the exam, then all three will be failed. If you do choose to take it,\Nbut get the wrong answer... then that person will be a\NGenin for the rest of their life! No matter what,\Nthe odds are against us! It's an impossible choice\Nfor anyone with normal nerves! Then, let's begin... The 10th question… Those who will not be taking it,\Nraise your hands! Once I confirm your number,\NI'll ask you to leave! What kind of a question\Nis it going to be….? Darn! If I get it wrong,\NI'll be a Genin for the rest of my life. I don't want that! But if I choose not take it...! then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!\NI don't want that either! I won't raise my hand! I'm confident that\NI can answer it correctly. But… But Naruto! You're different! You should retreat this time\Neven if it means to ignore us and think of your next chance\Nto take the Exam! I... I... I'm quitting!\NI'm not going to take it! #50 failed! # 130, #111 will be\Nfailed as well... I-I'm sorry...\NGennai! Inaho! Darn... M-Me too! Me too! Naruto... Why don't you raise your hand? That guy... I am the super elite ninja who will be carrying\Nthe name of the Hokage! My name is Naruto Uzumaki,\Nremember that! Shut up! I'm prepared to do anything\Nto become a Hokage! I will surpass the Hokage! And I will make all of\Nthe people in the village acknowledge my presence! He's always got such a one-track mind. Saying Hokage, Hokage\Nall the time like a fool. I'm sorry, Naruto. It seems like... I don't want to... crush your unachievable dreams. That guy... Ibiki completely understands how\Nthe human psyche works. And the most horrifying part is... that by cornering people psychologically\Nhe controls their psyche and reveals the fundamental\Nweakness of a human. Don't underestimate me!\NI won't run! I'll take it! But even if I'm stuck being\Na Genin forever, I will  become a Hokage\Nno matter what it takes! I'm not scared! That guy, he wasn't even\Nthinking of us at all. Such audacity! That's right… That's exactly the kind of fool you are! I'll ask again. It's a choice that will alter your life. If you want to quit, now is your chance! I'm not going to take back\Nmy words! That is my Way of Ninja! Huh... What a funny kid. He completely brushed away\Nthose kids' anxieties. 78, huh? Much more left\Nthan I expected. It's going to be the same.\NNo matter how much more I push it. I like your determination! Then... For those who are still here... The first exam... You have passed it! Huh? H-Hey, what does that mean? All of a sudden you're telling us\Nthat we've passed! What about the 10th question? There wasn't such\Na thing to begin with! Well, you can look at the choice you\Njust had to make as the 10th question! What?! Hey! Then, what were all\Nthose nine questions for! It was just a waste of time! Not a waste... The objective of the nine questions\Nwere already accomplished. To test your individual ability\Nto gather information! Ability to gather information? First… The focus of this test was on the system of determining\Nthe pass or failure based on the three-person groups\Nthat was proposed in the first rule. By grading the exam on\Na group basis, I added the unimaginable pressure\Nof dragging down your teammates. I see, I see. I kind of felt that was\Nthe point of this test! No , you didn't! However... The questions on these tests weren't\Nthings that you Genin Ninja would\Nhave been able to solve... So in that case… I imagined that most of you here\Nwould have come to this conclusion: ""In order to score points,\NI'll have to cheat."" In other words, this exam was created under the premise\Nthat you all would cheat! That being said, I had two Chunin in the group\Nwho knew all of the answers from whom you could cheat. What?! That's what it was? I had a hard time figuring\Nout the guy. Yeah. Really... It was so obvious! There's something wrong with you\Nif you didn't notice! Right, Hinata?! He... didn't realize it... However... those who just foolishly cheated,\Nnaturally were disqualified. That's because... Information, depending on\Nthe time and situation, it will be more valuable than life. And in a mission or on a battlefield, you will always have to risk your life\Nto fight for it! Horrible burn marks, nail punctures\Nand scratches... Those are signs of physical torture! When information is gathered and the enemy or a third party\Nfinds out about it, that information is no longer\Nguaranteed to be correct. Just remember this. To be given the wrong information can bring a catastrophic blow\Nto your friends and town. So that is why, out of necessity,\Nwe forced you guys to cheat in order to test your ability\Nto collect information. And we filtered out those who\Nwere clearly lacking in those abilities. But... The last question doesn't\Nmake any sense. However... this 10th question was\Nthe main issue of this first exam. Huh? What do you mean? I'll explain. The tenth question was to\Ntake on the question, or not. Needless to say, it is\Na painful decision to make. Those who chose not to\Ntake on the question, would be immediately failed\Nalong with their whole squad! Those who chose to answer\Nthe question and got it wrong… would be robbed of their chance\Nto take the Exam forever. It really is an unfair question. Then, how about these two choices? Let's say that you guys did\Nbecome a Chunin. The mission is to steal\Na secret document! You have no idea how many\NNinjas the enemy has, their ability, and other armament\Nthey may have. On top of that, there maybe\Nthe pitfall of an enemy trap. Now this mission...\NWill you take it? Or not take it? Because you want your life spared... Because your partners will\Nbe put in danger... Can you get away from\Ndangerous missions? The answer is... No! There are going to be missions\Nyou cannot avoid no matter how risky or\Ndangerous it may be! Showing your courage to\Nyour teammates in a tight spot, and the ability to get through\Nthe hardships... This is the quality that is needed\Nin a Chunin troop leader! In a pinch, there are\Nthose who cannot risk their own fate, and those who waver and give up\Ntheir chances because they think they\Nwill have another chance. I believe that such fools who don't have\Nstrong determination have no right to become a Chunin! For those of you who chose\Nto take on the question, you can say that you have successfully\Nanswered the difficult 10th question! You shall be able to take on\Nthe adversity that may lie in your way. You've passed through the gates! The fist exam for the Chunin Exam\Nhas been completed. I wish you well! All right! Wish us well! I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah! What a funny guy... W-What's going on?! Gosh, this one... You guys! This isn't the time to be\Ncelebrating! I'm the proctor for the second exam!\NAnko Mitarashi! Let's move onto\Nthe next stage! Next! Follow me! Read the atmosphere. This proctor...\Nls kind of like Naruto. 78?! Ibiki!\NYou let 26 teams slide by? I guess, the first exam this time around\Nwas too easy. It seems like this time,\Nthere are a lot of excellent candidates. Huh! Well, all right... I'll drop more than half of them\Nin the second exam! M-More than half? I'm getting excited. I'll give you the details tomorrow. We'll be changing locations, so get information from your Jonin\Nabout the location and the time! That's it. You're dismissed. I didn't think that there would be a guy\Nthat would pass with a blank sheet. Naruto Uzumaki...\NHe really is a funny guy. W-What is this place?! NO TRESPASSING This is the location for\Nthe ""second exam"", the 44th Training Field. Also known as... the Forest of Death. The Forest of... Death?! I passed the first exam! I'm just going to hop, jump\Nand take a big step and... Huh? Konohamaru and the gang? Hey, you guys! if you want to play a Ninja game... No? What?\NYou came here for a mission?!

Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga Withdraw! You’re not suited\Nto being a Shinobi. You don’t have the privilege of\Ndeciding what a person is like, stupid! Hinata, give it to him! Naruto… Don’t just take it! Argue back! I’m getting irritated watching this! Naruto... Thank you! The expression of her eyes\Nhas changed... So you're not going to withdraw? I’m not taking responsibility\Nfor what happens… I don’t want to run away! Byakugan! Brother Neji! I challenge you! Here! A Failure Stands Tall! As I thought, this is the extent of it… the head family’s power! What the--?! But Hinata laid a perfect strike! N-Not yet… What's with this guy…! I-It can't be…. Well, now…. I guess this is why he's called\Nthe most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet. Y-You mean… All this time…? That's right! I can see\Nthe Chakra Points. W-What is he talking about?! On the Chakra Network… there are 361 energy centers\Nor Chakra opening, each about the size\Nof the head of a pin. They're called Chakra Points. Theoretically, hitting one directly\Ncan halt or increase Chakra flow, enabling one to gain complete control over\Nan opponent's flow of Chakra. Just so you know, not even my Sharingan\Ncan see Chakra Points! Having the penetrating eye\Nis one thing, but to hit it so accurately like\Nthat during a match, well, that's just… Lady Hinata... What we have here is an unchangeable\Ndifference in abilities. It's what distinguishes\Nthe elite from the failure. It is brute, unalterable fact. You were destined to regret having said that you don't want to run anymore,\N the instant you said it. And now, you must have\Nabandoned yourself to despair! This is your ultimatum… Withdraw! I-I... I-I meant it... and am…sticking by… every word... Hinata… I said! I'm not gonna run away! Because that's…my Way of Ninja! I had no idea... Hinata was this tough… She's a lot like you. Come to think of it…\NShe's always watching you. Huh? Hinata… Bring it on! She has reached her limit. One more blow and… Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points have completely halted\Nher flow of Chakra. That means she can no longer\Nsend Chakra into her opponent's body\Nto fight in the Gentle Fist. This match is as good as over. But I never imagined there would\Nbe someone this powerful… I'm afraid even our Sasuke\Nis no match for him. It looks as if Neji may very well\Ntake this Exam. It's going to take more than what\Nthis girl has to bring him down. L-Look at those eyes… Is he going to try to kill her?\NNo, no, that's absurd. Doesn't it seem that… Neji’s strength is somehow\Nagainst the rules? He's just too powerful… I mean it! Go, Hinata! Naruto... Strength has come back\Ninto her eyes… I've been watching you… I've been watching you closely\Nfor many years now! Why I wonder…? Next up is Naruto Uzumaki! What a pain! It's all your fault! Like I care! Okay! Naruto… d-do your best. Transformation! I don't know why, but… I am Naruto Uzumaki! I'm not about to lose to\Nthe likes of any of you! Is that perfectly clear?! I'm not about to lose to\Nthe likes of any of you? Yeah, right! That idiot. He made a roomful of enemies\Nin the space of an instant. When I watch Naruto... Naruto, stand up! If you compete with me\Nfor the name of Hokage… You… will be the loser! I can feel courage welling up. I feel that I can hang on,\Nthat I can do it… that I too am worth something! Oh! – No! 					– Hinata! Hinata... At some point, Hinata, who was\Nin the habit of just giving up, made up her mind to change. Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home. She put every ounce of\Nher being into her training. I saw it with my own eyes. But even so, she continued\Nto fail all her missions. She lost her nerve when\Nfaced with real competition and became easily discouraged. But today's Hinata is different. I have never… seen…that look in her eyes before. Naruto. I have always done\Nthe watching up to now, but, now, finally… finally, I am… Naruto! You just don't get it, do you? Your strikes were ineffective\Nfrom the very first. It's the end. Hinata… That's enough. You lost the match, but you've become a new person\Nin the process. You did well. I want to change that about myself… So I proposed it myself… Neji's final blow went\Nstraight for the heart. I feel sorry for her, but she won't be standing\Nagain now. As further fighting is not feasible\Nunder these conditions… Don't stop it! Don't stop the match!\NBelieve it! Naruto, stop! What on earth are you saying, stupid! She's had it. You can see\Nshe's unconscious… Huh? Why do you stand up? If you continue like this,\Nyou’ll really die! He is now finally for\Nthe first time truly seeing me. I will not be caught looking bad... Why?! in front of... the person I admire most. I-I am far from finished! Give up the bravado… I can tell you're just\Nbarely standing. You've shouldered the lot\Nof having been born to the head family line of the Hyuga… And cursed and blamed\Nyourself for being weak... But, people cannot change. That's just the way it is. There is no need for you\Nto suffer any more! Surrender to it! You're wrong... Brother Neji. Because I can tell… that you are suffering\Nmuch more than I. What?! You are the one who is torn up over the fate of head\Nand branch family. Neji, the match has been called! Oh boy! Neji, get a hold of yourself! You promised me you wouldn't let the head family\Nthing get you riled up! Why are all the other Jonin\Nbutting in?! The head family gets\Nspecial treatment, eh? Hinata?! Hinata! Hinata! Hinata! Hinata! Are you okay?! Hey! Naruto… Yeah. I… Do you think… I…changed maybe a little bit? Hey you, failure! I have two pieces\Nof advice for you. First, if you intend to\Ncall yourself a Shinobi, stop that revolting cheering of yours. And the second... a failure will always be a failure. There's no changing that! Do you want to see about that? You! Naruto, I get where you're\Ncoming from, believe me. But all fighting must be\Ndone officially in a match! The failure beats the gifted genius\Nthrough sheer effort… Wouldn't that make for\Nan exciting main battle? Though, I am probably going\Nto be the one fighting Neji… but it would be okay with me\Nif you ended up fighting him, Naruto. All right already. So this is okay then,\Nright, Guy Sensei? Lee! You…. Nice going! Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib. Was he trying to kill her then?! The precious little time you have\Nwould be better spent seeing to her than glaring at me. Medics! Hurry! What's taking so long?! S-Sorry. Get her on the stretcher.\NOne, two, three. It's serious. She 's got about\N10 minutes at the most! Get her to the emergency room.\NPronto! Out of the way!

135,"Hey boys, listen up! Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something The Promise That Could Not Be Kept Kakashi Sensei… Where’s Sasuke? Kakashi! How is Naruto Uzumaki’s condition? He’s okay. What about Sasuke?\NWhere’s Sasuke Uchiha?! How are the other Genin? Yes! By Lady Hokage’s order, the first and second medical corps\Nhave been dispatched… The wounded from all areas have\Nalready been gathered. They were convoyed after\Nadministering emergency treatment. How are their conditions? Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries… Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,\Nbut it’s not life-threatening. Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi\Nare in serious condition… At this point,\Nthere’s no telling what will happen. Everyone… The ingredients and\Neffects of the medicine have been thoroughly researched. Excellent… Now bring the deer antler! Yes, ma’am! How is he…Big Sister? No walks for him for quite a while… The muscles of his limbs\Nhave been severely damaged. You’re a vet, right, Big Sister?\NCan’t you somehow…? It’ll be okay. It’ll take time. But there’s no threat\Nto his life, so rest easy. Walks for you are out of the question\Nfor quite a while, too! Yeah, I know… Intensive Care Unit 7 It’ll soon be three hours…\NPlease take over. All right! Although we’re making\Nthis kid’s hair into a conductor, please don’t mistake the cellular rate\Nof the deficient parts! Right! As for the Chakra control, handle it\Nas if we’re threading a needle! Understood! Intensive Care Unit 6 There’s no point in\Nyou getting frustrated, right? Missions come with sacrifice… You took the mental training, right? Training and actual battle\Nare different, you know… I know what missions are about… And I thought I knew what\Nthe Shinobi world is like. I became a platoon leader\Nfor the first time on this mission. With that, I understood… I’m not cut out to be a Shinobi. Surprisingly fragile…for a man. This time… The only thing I was able to do\Nas platoon leader… was to believe in everyone. I was naïve… I didn’t have enough power… It’s all my fault! Are you afraid of getting hurt? Shikamaru… Are you going to be argued down\Nby a girl and run away? It’s a drag… I don’t want to have arguments.\NI’m not a woman. Yeah… But you’re not a man, either. You’re just a coward! Even if you quit being Shinobi,\Nthe missions will continue. Someone has to do it. Your comrades will just\Nbe dispatched again… under a different platoon leader. And your comrades might die there. But if at that time,\Nyou were the platoon leader… your comrades might be saved\Nfrom that happening to them. If you reflect on this time,\Nmake use of the experience and learn, you might be able to carry out missions\Nwith more perfection. If you really think your comrades\Nare important to you, before you think about running away… think about becoming more exceptional\Nfor the sake of your comrades! That’s what real comrades are,\Nyou coward! Intensive Care Unit 6 He’s okay, now! The antidote has stopped\Nthe death of cells caused by the side effects of the Pills. You were a big help this time, Shikaku! The Nara Clan’s secret medicinal\Npreparation manual was very useful. It must’ve been tough to\Nmake something like that… It’s the result of day-to-day study. Thanks… Lady Tsunade! Neji Hyuga…\NHis safety line has been secured. And, there’s some information… Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki\Nhave just now returned. Although seriously injured,\Nit seems it’s not life-threatening. Two, huh? Shikamaru…\Nlt seems the mission is a failure. But, everyone is alive!\NThat’s the most important thing. Next time for sure… I’ll carry out the mission perfectly! Sasuke…You’re the chosen one. Whatever… Just give me “power.” Even though the form is different,\Nit’s still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes. If you don’t want to die,\Nuse more care in how you talk. Wh-What? This quality of Chakra… Yes… My future is inside this kid… Hidden Leaf Hospital I’m going to where Orochimaru is! Please…bring back Sasuke! I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!\NI promise that on my life! Oh…You were awake, huh? Shikamaru! I’m going on ahead to Choji!\NWhat about you? I’m going on ahead to…\NNaruto and Sasuke! I see… So everyone’s okay.\NThat’s good. Then, Sasuke… Yeah…he's gone. Intensive Care Unit 6 Then, I still can’t see him…? Yeah… But Lady Tsunade said that\Nhe should regain consciousness soon. Thank goodness… It’s really a great help that Lady Tsunade returned\Nto the Leaf Village. If she hadn’t, right about now,\NChoji would be… The Lady Fifth…Hokage. You’ve come to visit? Information sure travels fast. Sakura… Naruto… I heard you suffered\Nquite a serious injury… But you look well, considering. I’m sorry… Sakura… Why do you apologize? Being you, you probably\Ngot reckless again, right?! Jeez, you look like a mummy… I’m sorry… I… Hey… The weather’s nice today.\NSo open the curtains. Sakura! I… I’ll keep my promise, no matter what! I promised on my life.\NThat’s what I said, so I…! It’s okay already, Naruto… Sakura! He… I always… said that, so… I… I stick straight to what I say! That’s my Way of Ninja! Naruto… Thanks, Naruto… I’ll get right to healing this injury\Nand I’ve got to bring Sasuke back! Wh-What was that?! Per…Pervy Sage?! Yo! I’ve come today to tell you\Nsomething important. From here on,\Nas my official disciple, I’ll train you to become\Na full-fledged Shinobi in three years. Three years…? I’ve received some credible information\Nfrom a certain source concerning the “Akatsuki.” Akatsuki… It seems that it will be\Nthree or four years before they come after you next. I don’t care about that! Talking about stuff that’s\Nso far down the road… I don’t have the time\Nto be doing slowpoke training! What do you mean? If I don’t go after\NSasuke immediately, he might be killed by Orochimaru! “Immortal” doesn’t mean that\Nthe flesh is being maintained as is. Before his body decays, a strong and new flesh will be made\Ninto a vessel for his soul. It seems you’ve learned\Nof the true purpose for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke… Huh?! Then that means you also knew…? I was looking into\NOrochimaru’s Immortality Jutsu. It seems with that Jutsu, he can’t reincarnate into\Nthe next body for three years. And unable to wait for Sasuke,\Nhe just recently reincarnated… It’ll be okay for three years from now…\NThere is time. That’s not a lie, is it?! Not a lie, is it?! Nope… However… Forget about Sasuke… Sasuke went to Orochimaru\Non his own accord. No matter what you do,\Nhe won’t change. I’ve seen many Shinobi, so I know… Sasuke is the same kind\Nas Orochimaru. If you’re thinking about bringing him back,\Njust forget it. That’s something an arrogant fool\Nwould do! He may be nothing to you\Nbut he’s my friend! Would a friend hurt his comrade?! Take a look at your current plight! This is…! Why? Why would you…? We were called Sannin together… Weren’t we comrades\Nsince we were kids?! In every regard,\Nyou’re a foolish guy, Jiraiya… You lack thought\Nin everything you do. That’s why you didn’t notice\Nwhat I was doing. Can’t you rethink it, Orochimaru? Absurd! How can you be so stupid?! No matter how much I wanted it… in the end, there was no way\Nhe would come back. After the agony, all that’s left was\Nmy own powerlessness and regret. I don’t want you to go through\Nthe same thing… If you’re going to go after Sasuke,\Nthen there’ll be no training. I’ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you and depending on the case,\Nprohibit you from leaving the village. You’re not just an ordinary kid… You possess the Nine Tail Fox\Nthat the Akatsuki is after! This is serious.\NI'll just have to do that… if you’re going to act on your own\Nwithout listening to what I say. Eventually, you’re going to have to deal with guys more troublesome\Nthan Orochimaru. Give up on Sasuke. Sooner or later this was\Ngoing to happen. Don’t suffer anymore!\NForget and dismiss him. It’s not just Jutsu or power… If you’re a Shinobi, develop eyes that\Ncan make the right judgment. And if you’re going to live\Nas a Shinobi, become wise. If you remain a fool… the reality is that it will be tough\Nliving in this world. Fine. If that’s what being wise is… Then I’m fine being a fool for life! Even if by myself, I’ll create even more awesome Jutsu\Nand save Sasuke no matter what! And, and,\NI’ll even kick the Akatsuki’s butt! If someone like you\Nwere to do it alone… the best you’d be able\Nto come up with would be some\Nstupid erotic Jutsu, anyway. It might somehow work out if you are a big fool and\Nnot an ordinary fool… Be prepared once\Nyou’re out of the hospital, you big fool. See you then. Roger! – It’s been seven years since…\N– …all the members gathered like this. Since Orochimaru left\Nthe organization. That Orochimaru has gotten\Nthe Sharingan. Itachi…Your little brother? Don’t get hasty. Yeah. We’ll kill Orochimaru eventually… More importantly,\Nthere are only three years left. Can everyone accomplish\Nthe work required of them? Huh? Yes, our goal is… to get everything,\Nincluding the Nine Tail Fox in question! When I recalled the parts one by one, I felt as though\NI had understood everything Faded words which I kept so close to me Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and this distant yearning for you I live, simply repeating this cycle Held in my two hands\NA droplet of time Softly clutching forgotten memories\NLost words I’ll keep these thoughts… Sakura’s been weird all along\Never since Sasuke left. I can’t put it well, but she’s gloomy or fretting\Nor something. On top of that she says,\N“This time I’ll do my best on my own.” What the heck does that mean? It’s bugging me, it’s bugging me!

Rockin' my heart What's with you?! Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns! Good morning! Here. Thank you. Naruto didn't come back\Nlast night, either? He's such a fool, he's been out every night,\Nclimbing trees. He might be dead already\Nfrom using up too much Chakra. I wonder if Naruto's okay. To think a child's out in\Nthe middle of the night. Well, you don't need to worry. Although he may not seem to be,\Nhe's a full-fledged Ninja. I wonder… That idiot's probably\Nall pooped out right about now. Sasuke? I'm going for a walk. But we're about to eat… That was fast! You'll catch a cold if\Nyou keep sleeping here. Who're you? Uh... Did you wake me up, sis?\NI mean, what're you doing here? I'm gathering medicinal herbs. Herbs? Yes. For healing injuries,\Nsickness and the like. You got a lot to do early\Nin the morning, sis... You, too. What've you been doing\Nin a place like this so early? Training! Could it be that…\Nyou're a Ninja or something? What with that headband and… Is that what I look like? Is it? Yup! I'm a Ninja! No kidding.\NYou're great, aren't you. But…why are you training? As for me,\NI want to get stronger! But, you already look\Nstrong enough. No, no! I want to get\Neven stronger! What for? To become the best Ninja\Nin my village! I'm going to get everyone\Nto recognize my strength! And I have to prove something\Nto a certain person! Is that for the sake of somebody?\NOr is it for your own sake? Huh? What's so funny?! Do you have somebody\Nprecious in your life? Precious…? What is it you want to say, sis? What is it? When a person has something\Nprecious they want to protect… that's when they can truly\Nbecome strong. Your dad loves the town\Nyou're from, so… I absolutely won't allow\Nmy comrades to get killed! Get your hands off Iruka Sensei! I'll kill you!! Yeah! I know that well, too! You'll get strong. Yeah! I hope we meet again somewhere. Oh…and… I'm a man! That can't be!\NHe's cuter than Sakura. Why? That's strange. This world is full of mystery… Ouch.\NHey! What're you doing?! Did you forget about mealtime,\Nyou idiot? Naruto? What in the world is Naruto doing? And Sasuke hasn't come back\Nfrom his walk either… No way…\NNaruto can climb that high now? Wow! How 'bout that, how 'bout that?! As for me,\NI can climb this high now! Whoa! Oh, you idiot! This is bad! Gotcha! You fell for it, you fell for it! Don't scare us like that! I'll kill him later! Cha! He's grown a little, eh. Oh! You idiot, Naruto! It's cuz you went overboard! You fool. Sasuke…? Nice, Sasuke.\NYou're awesome ! These kids are really growing. Naruto… Uzumaki, eh. You've recovered considerably. All right… Just a little more, Haku. Yes. Shall we go back? Okay! They're late. And not just Naruto,\Nbut even Sasuke too. What happened to you guys? You're really muddy\Nand really wiped out. We both…climbed up to the top. Good. Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding\NTazuna next time! Got it! Whoa! You idiot! In just a teeny little bit,\Nthe bridge will be complete. It's thanks to you guys. Even so, don't let your guard down… I've really wanted to ask\N you for a long time now… But why are you still here\Neven though I lied about the mission? To see what is right without doing it\Nbespeaks an absence of courage. Like master, like man. It's a teaching of the late Hokage. The things I truly\Nhold dear to myself… I'll protect until the very end\Nwith both these arms. Don't cry…lnari. Why…? What is it? Why do you desperately work so hard\Nuntil you get like that?! There's no way you'd be\Na match for Gato's men even if you train! No matter what cool things you say\Nor how much effort you make… the weak always lose out… against the truly strong! Shut up. I'm not like you. Shut up!\NLooking at you makes me sick! Sticking your nose in even though\Nyou know nothing of this land! I'm not like you who's always\Nacting frivolous not knowing one thing about pain! So you're just gonna cry\Nall day like the lead in a tragedy? An idiot like you can just cry forever!\NYou crybaby! Naruto! That's a bit harsh! Naruto… Got a minute? Naruto didn't mean any harm\Nwith what he said… He's just uncouth, so… We heard the story\Nabout your father from Tazuna. Like you, Naruto never had\Na father as a young child… Actually he doesn't know either\Nof his parents. Not only that.\NHe didn't have a single friend. What? However… I've never seen him sulk,\Nbe timid, or cry. He's always eager,\Nwanting to be acknowledged by someone. If it's for the sake of that ""dream,""\Nhe always risks his life. He's probably tired of crying. So, he knows the true meaning\Nof the word strong. Like your father. Naruto might understand your feelings\Nthe most. What Naruto said earlier… There's no mistaking that\Nhe's told himself that over and over again. Okay, then!\NI leave Naruto in your hands. Because he's used his body\Nto the limit… I don't think he'll be able\Nto move today. Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right? Yes, somehow. We'll be going! What're you doing? I didn't hire you guys for charity work… Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?!\NHey!! Shall we go…Haku? Yes. I overslept! Hey hey!! Where is everyone? Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you\Nto rest and relax…today I knew it. They left me behind. I'll be back. Darn it!\NThey could've woken me up! W-What the heck is this?! What is going on?\NWhat's happened?

This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?! Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi. I see you've got those brats\Nwith you as always. He's still trembling. Poor thing. I'm trembling with…excitement. Do it, Sasuke. I can see it! Well-well. So he could\Nsee the Water Clones, eh. That brat's grown quite a bit. This means a rival has emerged, Haku. So it seems. Phew, that was a close shave. Sorry I was late.\NBut Inari, you were great. I was able to save your mom\Nthanks to your courage. Hey, wait a minute.

Huh? None? What are you talking about…? To pull out enormous Chakra\Nand use it. It is certain that it is difficult\Nto have the control to do it… It is also certain that this body\Nis a vessel too small to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra… It’s likely that Naruto’s body normally\Ntends to reject the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox\Nin order to avoid too much strain. If the excitement of danger and\Nemotion are the key to drawing out the\NNine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra… he has to learn physically until\Nhe can automatically use that key.

It’s impossible… This rock surface is slippery\Nfrom the seepage of the waterfall. Besides, falling in that speed\Nwith the control of Chakra that you have, you can’t cling to the rock.

Those guys,\Nwhere’s the Sound Village Ninjas? A kid named Sasuke\Ndrove them away! Really… Why did you hastily decided\Nto act on your own?! Besides, you really got beaten up! S-Sakura was in danger.\NSo as a man, I... You’re kidding...! If it were Lee alone,\Nhe wouldn’t have lost to those guys. You’re really stupid. I can’t argue with that. You, Bushy-Brow! Naruto! Don’t say rude things to Lee! What in the world... happened while I was asleep? That Naruto,\Nhe’s completely out of the loop. He’s not the type to be\Nthe protagonist of a story, certainly not. Lee... Thank you. Because of you,\NI was able to wake up. I feel like I’ve gotten a little stronger! Sakura... It looks like my efforts\Nweren’t enough! Sasuke... Just what you’d expect\Nfrom the Uchiha clan. To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas, just as I thought,\Nyou possess amazing strength. I was beaten to a pulp. What?! He was beaten to a pulp?! What’s he talking about? Were those guys really that strong? Sakura! The Lotus of Leaf Village\Nblooms twice. Huh? When we meet again,\NI will have become a stronger man. I pledge it. Okay. Hey Sakura! Come here, come here! Your hair! I’ll fix it for you! That'd be great. You are really sneaky. Hugging him like that,\Nyou little billboard brow. It’s called first come-first served,\NMiss Ino-pig. Sasuke... Uchiha. At any rate…he’s a strong opponent. Are you okay, Akamaru? Is he still shaking? It’s already been half a day. Akamaru... I don’t blame him,\N it’s because he saw that thing... After all, brains are most important\Nin survival! Right. Akamaru? Lucky for us, the guys who got caught in\Nthe trap had an earth scroll! We’ll be the first to\Nthe tower at this rate! Don’t get carried away.\NThat’s dangerous. No matter how small a bug it is,\Nit has to guard itself at all times. We have to pay attention to avoid\Ncoming across any enemies... This is safety. I know that! As always, you’re speaking in a way\Nthat’s difficult to understand, bug-nerd. Um... B-But...\NWhat Shino said... He has a point. I know! C’mon. Naruto... I hope nothing’s happened to him... Hey you two, stop. We’re being careful not to\Ncome across enemy, right? Then Hinata! Can you see 1 kilometer\Nin that direction? Yep... I’ll have a look.\NByakugan! T-There’s someone there. Evidently there are... 6 people… Okay! Let’s go look! Huh? Kiba! What are you saying?\NWe’re not doing that. The Proctor told us to bring one of each “Heaven” and “Earth”\Nscroll in a pair. He didn’t say not to\Ntake more than that. If we take more, that means\Nsome other teams will be left out. B-But... We’ll just see what’s going on at first.. If it looks too dangerous,\Nwe won’t battle for no reason. – Let’s go! 					– Oh! He’s an irritating type, that one. What’s up, Akamaru? What happened? You stopped suddenly. Akamaru suddenly got frightened. W-Why is that? Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy’s\NChakra and tell his strength. But this is the first time I’ve\Nseen him this scared. The people going at it up ahead\Naren’t ordinary guys... Sand Village kids coming\Nto challenge us forthright. It’s foolish. What’s that little guy thinking\Nto get involved with those guys...?! W-What is Akamaru saying...? He’s saying that big guy is dangerous. T-They certainly look like bad news... They seem really strong. Hey, kids, you should\Npick your opponents... You’re all going to die. That’s enough of you. Let’s do this quickly...\Nold chap from Hidden Rain Village. Which scroll do those guys have... Hey Gaara! Doesn’t it make sense to\Nfollow them and gather information\Nbefore hunting them? If they have the same type of scroll\Nthere’s no need to fight. Unnecessary battles are…. It doesn’t matter. If their eyes meet with mine...\NI’ll kill them all. That’s why I don’t want\N to be with this guy. Well, let’s do it. Quickly! Die, kid! Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm! Hidden Senbons! Up down right left,\Nthere is no dead spot in this Jutsu. In addition, all the Senbons are\Ncontrolled by my Chakra and attack on the intended prey! Too easy. Is that all? I-It can’t be...?! Not even one...? No wounds...? Ridiculous! Senbon Rainstorm, huh...? Well, I’ll make it rain blood. What a giant Chakra. And, that sand... It smells terrible. Smell? A strong smell of blood... Wall of sand...? That’s right.\NAn absolute defense by sand! He manipulates sand inside\Na gourd and hardens it with magnified Chakra. It defends the circumference\Nof Gaara’s body. It’s a Jutsu that only\Nhe can get away with... Furthermore, it’s somehow always\Nautomatically done without Gaara’s intentions. Which means that all attacks\Nin front of Gaara fade into nothing. That little... You guys can’t defeat our Gaara. Don’t underestimate me! This guy's a goner… That’s what you get for rebelling\Nagainst Gaara... Sand Coffin! I can’t move... T-This won’t...! I can cover your loud mouth\Nand kill you. But that’s too pathetic. Sand Burial! There’s no pain. I knocked him even harder\Nthan was necessary. The bloody tears of a corpse merge\Nwith vast sinking sand and provide more power\Nto the demon of war. T-The scroll. We’ll give it to you! Please! Let us go! No-o-o-! T-This is bad. Let’s escape quickly!\Nlf he finds us he’ll kill us! Luckily it is a Heaven scroll. Okay! Let’s go to the tower. Shut up. It’s still…not enough for me! U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?! Let’s quit... Gaara. Are you scared, coward? Gaara! It’s certainly no problem for you,\Nbut it’s too dangerous for us! One set of scrolls is good. More than this is... Lame people don’t give directions to me. That’s enough! How about if you sometimes listen\Nto what your big brother has to say?! I’ve never thought of you as my siblings. If you get in my way... I’ll kill you. G-Gaara cut it out! Please. Don’t say something so cold. As a favor to your sister... Okay?! Gaara! Fine. That’s why I hate brats. What? So that’s it Akamaru? C’mon, you should have\Nsaid something sooner. Nobody’s here...? Heh heh! We’re the first?! No, I sensed someone a little while ago. More importantly, is Akamaru okay? He’s been scared ever since then. Now that you mention it,\Nwhat did Akamaru say before? Oh... Akamaru said that it\Nwas dangerous because that sand squirt\Nwould kill that big guy. Sheesh! Just like I thought,\Nthere’s no other place to go! They’ve already made us\Nwait for half a day! How much longer do we have to wait? Anyway. That Sand Village squirt... I don’t know what he is but,\Nthat guy… He’s too dangerous. It’s becoming a real disaster,\Nbut we can’t cancel this test. What do you mean? Excuse me! What is it?!\NWe’re talking about something important! Excuse me. But... Uh... Please take a look at this! The video...? Ready? Here! Look at the time! T-This is… It’s a recording inside the tower, one hour and thirty-seven minutes\Nafter the start of the second test! Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village\Nbroke through the second test. This can’t be...! In a mere ninety-seven minutes... This has never happened! This is an anomaly. Those guys are not Genin level. They’ve rewritten the\Nfastest time by four hours… It’s not just that. What do you mean? It’s 10 kilometers\Nfrom the test entrances to the tower. Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,\Nthe rugged forest road... As if those were not there… Especially the brown-haired kid\Nright in front… What about him? You don’t notice? I see. This is quite a surprise. What about him is so...? Look closely at his body. I see. He doesn’t have a single scratch. What’s worse, there's not\Na smudge of dirt on his clothing. Even I... No, any of the other Chunin... It’s impossible for us to\Nmake it to this tower without a scratch. It’s likely that it has something\Nto do with his ability. After a long time, a dependable\Nguy has appeared. Even though he’s got evil eyes. Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry, and you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? – Please! 					– No! – Just a little bit. 					– No! – Really only a little bit.\N– No means no! I’ll just look a little and put it back. Remember what the\NProctors said, loser. When they say don’t look, don’t look, it just makes me want\Nto look all the more!

From here on is an issue\Nfor the Hidden Star. It’s none of our concern! That being said, are we just going\Nto leave them be? Anything further would be beyond\Nthe scope of the mission… The Leaf must not betray the client\Nof the accepted mission, right? Damn it! Oh well. The star has returned.\NI’ll overlook everyone’s actions today. Those who wish to continue to live\Nfor the sake of the village, come with me… B-But…Sumaru is… Forsake the son of the traitor. Pull out! Yes, my lord! I’m sorry. I must not leave\NSumaru behind. Rogue Ninja! Hokuto! You’ll regret this! Well, do as you like! That jerk…! Hey, look…! It’s called Natsuboshi. It’s the other name for\Nthe planet Mars, right? It seems it’s the same name\Nas Sumaru’s mom… Sumaru thinks that star\Nis protecting him. I bet Lady Natsuhi was also\Nlooking at that star. I’m moved. The hearts of parent and child\Nare connected! Yeah… How’re the two doing? They’re resting comfortably now… But Akahoshi attack\Nthe mother took when her body was weakened\Nfrom the effects of the star is a fatal one. Her Chakra Network is in shreds\Nand it will mean certain death if she uses that Jutsu\Neven one more time… Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could… Who knows…? Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk\Nis unforgivable! I’ll kick his butt! Naruto…! You still don’t get it? But he’s a huge scoundrel. That’s right! The Leaf would lose credibility if we do something like betraying a client. But we can’t leave things be, right? Well, I also understand what\NNeji’s saying. We must ask the Lady Hokage\Nfor instructions. That’s right. Anyway, let’s take those two to\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. Yeah… The Hidden Star matter\Nwill come after that. Sumaru. Mother! Mother. You’re probably angry,\Naren’t you, Sumaru…? Of course, you would resent me…\Nwho abandoned the village and went so far as to entrust you\Nto someone else. How often I attempted to take you\Nwith me… But I kept telling myself that I couldn’t make you happy since\NI had become a Rogue Ninja… with this body that could\Ngive out at any time due to the star training. Stay away! I often had the same dream. A dream where I chase\Nafter you two, crying. Sumaru. Mother! I kept telling myself that my mother was not\Na cold-hearted person who would leave me behind… You had died. Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said. He said you had been killed by\Na Ninja from some other land, died and turned into a star… He said you had turned\Ninto the Natsuhiboshi…! Sumaru… Mother! Even so… Even so…I wanted you to\Ntake me with you. Sumaru… I was lonesome… Mother… Natsuboshi, why are you so red? Because I had a sad dream last night My eyes are red, from the tears I shed Swollen as I cried… Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way? I'm searching for a child\Nwho has gone afar He can't be found. though I search all day My sad dreams come once more Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru! Where’s the lady? Your mom. Hey, where’d she go? What?! This is bad… Mother! Even if it costs my life,\NI can’t let that star be… There mustn’t be any more\Nsad mothers and children! Can’t let it happen.\Nlf she gets reckless… and ends up using that Jutsu again… It became the village’s power\Nand protected the village. I didn’t want to have to destroy it… But star, you have caused\Npain and suffering to one too many of the children… Forgive me… Akahoshi… Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast! Sumaru… So your strength has given out?\NHow tragic. Mother… Hey, what’s the matter? It couldn’t be! Lady Natsuhi is… Mother died! As of this moment, I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name\Nof Fourth Hoshikage! I shall announce the first mission\Nas Hoshikage. The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto, and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi\Nare enemies who demean us! If you find them attempting\Nto enter the village, bring them down immediately! Yes, my lord! I will… I will get the one who killed\Nmy mother! Sumaru! Yesterday’s Call Sign,\Nwas all from my cell phone. In a strange park,\NI play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm. Yellow Moon.

24,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for\Nthe first test of the Chunin Exam. You, from Hidden Sound Village! No doing as you please\Nbefore the Exam! You want to be failed\Nat the get go?! Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,\Nso we flipped out... despite ourselves. Hmph. This is a good opportunity,\N so I'll say this. There will be no battles,\Ncompetitions and the like without the permission\Nof the proctors! And even if you get permission, actions that could lead to the death\Nof an opponent will not be permitted. Any pig that screws with me\Nwill be disqualified immediately. Got it?! This Exam looks to be easy! Now then, we will start\Nthe first test of the Chunin Exam! Turn in your applications, take one of these number cards\Nin exchange, and sit in the seat\Nmatching that number! After that, we will hand out\Nthe paper for the written test! Written...? Paper...? Paper... A paper test?! Start Your Engines:\NThe Chunin Exam Begins! Everyone's seats are all scattered...\NWhat should I do? He's deflated, deflated... It's the worst type of test for Naruto... Naruto... Oh! You are Hinata...!\NSince when have you...? L-Let's both do our best. Y-Yeah. I didn't notice her at all. Hinata has no presence at all... There are several important\Nrules to this first test. I will take no questions,\Nso listen well accordingly! Rules? No questions will be taken...? First off is the first rule! You are given ten points\Neach from the start! The written test has\Nten problems in all! Each problem is one point. And, this test is a\Npoint deduction system. You are deducted one point for\Neach problem you get wrong! If you get three wrong,\Nyou'll have seven points! If I get ten wrong,\NI'll have zero points... The second rule. Pass or failure will be determined by the total points of\Nthe three-person teams. W-Wait a minute! What do you mean...\Ntotal points of the teams? Shut up! There's a perfectly\Ngood reason for this! Shut up and listen! Reason...? If you've got it,\Nhere is the most important next rule! Those who are deemed by\Nthe sentinels as having committed an act of\Ncheating or something similar to that... will have two points deducted\N for each act. What...? Oh! In other words... there may be those who will be\Ndismissed during this test without waiting for test grading. This means they're deducting points from things other\Nthan the written test problems. Know that those who\Ncommit awkward cheating... will bring ruin upon yourselves. I'll check you anytime. If you aspire to become\Na Chunin at all, know that Shinobi should act\Nlike exemplary Shinobi. Relax...! 					Yes... yes! Naruto aside,\NSasuke and I are okay! Even if Naruto gets zero points...\Nif we cover that... And, in the case of even one person\Non the team getting zero points... Everyone on that team will fail! Wha--?! What did he say...?! I feel two menacing stares... Naruto? By the way, the last problem will\Nbe given forty-five minutes after the start of the test! The time for the test is one hour. Begin! Could it... Could it be that,\Nthe fat is really on the fire now...? Naruto...!\NJust don't get zero points! Naruto isn't getting jitters\Nfrom the get go, is he...? This is bad... As if! I know I've cleared many obstacles\Nlike this before... At times like this, one should\Nlook at all the problems without feeling pressed\Nor making a fuss! And then with utmost effort I should tackle the problems that look\Neasy to understand! Let's see, the first problem...\Nis a code text, eh... Excellent, I say! Next! Next! Let's see... the second problem... The parabola B in the diagram illustrates\Nthe greatest possible distance Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken\Nfrom a tree seven meters high... Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's\Ncharacter inferred from the ellipse this Shuriken forms, also answer the longest firing range\Nin battle on flat ground and explain your basis. T-This is an... integrated problem based\Non predictions of uncertain conditions and\Ndynamic energy analysis application...! There's no way\NNaruto can solve this! I mean... hardly anyone except me\Ncan solve this problem! Okay, next! 					Next! These other problems...\Nare nothing but difficult ones. I see... I don't... understand even\None of these problems. Oh, no, this is bad! For real! For real! What should I do?\NWhat should I do? What should I do? If about ten of all fifty-one teams\Nare able to pass, it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself and\Nget a considerable amount of points. It's like a system inviting cheating... I hope Sasuke and Naruto\Nwon't panic and cheat. It's okay...\NNaruto's not that much of an idiot... I know that... Don't panic... For now, all there is to do is to be\Nvery, very cautious... and cheat without being found out! No! No! I can't, that's no good,\Nno good! I can't tread on such thin ice! At any rate, this elaborate fuss... It's like a trick assuming\Nthat we're going to cheat. They probably check with that paper... Somebody got nailed. Cheating deducts two points. Two-point deduction, huh... Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment\Nthe cheating was discovered... Know that those who\Ncommit awkward cheating will bring ruin upon themselves. Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi. I see, so that's how it is, eh. This wasn't just an achievement test! The real aim was... a test to see the ability\Nfor intensive information collection with the full use of deception\Nand concealment techniques. ""Shinobi should read\N the double bluff,"" eh... In other words, the true intention\Nof the proctor is... if you're going to cheat,\Nnot ""awkward cheating,"" but ""like exemplary Shinobi"",\Ndon't get caught. Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness\Nof the point deduction system, the lenience of only deducting two points\Nfor each discovery of cheating makes sense. In other words, what's being tested here is how\Nwe can gather the correct answers without having our cheating detected\Nby the proctors or by the one being cheated on. Realize it quick, Naruto! It'll turn into a fatal mistake! Realize it! This is bad. Believe it... If the purpose of this test is seeing\Nthe ability to gather information... then there should be someone\Nin this classroom somewhere... who knows the answers\Nto the problems! So Gaara has also started, eh... Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow. Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!\NNext is problem four! Judging from this rhythm... The stroke order...\Nand the number of strokes... I see. Okay! Please tell me. Eight, huh. Lee, if you can see it,\Nwear your headband! Time is rapidly going by! Oh, man! I'm afraid all there\Nis to do is cheat... But, if I'm discovered, it'll be trouble for Sakura\Nand Sasuke. On the other hand,\Nif I get zero points... Sakura and Sasuke will be\Nmy companions in failure. Naruto... I'll show you... my test. Huh...? What is Hinata saying...? W-Why would she do\Nsuch a thing for me? Could it be... some kind of trickery? But Hinata is not one to do\Nsomething like that... No... But she might've been coaxed into\Nattempting to trap me by Kiba and others... Hinata, let me ask you one thing! Huh?! Why would you show me? Uh... uh... actually... I...I... I don't want you, Naruto...\Nto leave at this stage... Y-You see...\Nthe nine of us are the only rookies... and I have many anxieties about\Nwhat's to come, so! I get it now! I was kind of\Nstrangely suspicious of you! Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say! Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata... W-What was that?\NI was about to turn... W-What was that for, sir?! You made five mistakes. You fail! N-No way... His two buddies, both of you get out\Nof the classroom, right now. ♪ 23 fails! ♪ 43 and ♪27 fail! Noooo! Hey, hey! Do you have proof that\NI cheated five whole times?! Really, are you guys properly checking\Nthis number of people...? Listen up... Even among us Chunin, we're elite\Nwho were selected for this Exam. We don't overlook you blinking once... In a matter of speaking,\Nthis strength is the proof. Naruto...? Hurry... Look... Hinata... You don't get it, do you? What...? An awesome ninja like me\Nwon't cheat. Believe it! N-Naruto. B-But... Also, if something went wrong, you'd be in a hot spot for\Nhelping me cheat, right?! \What?! Naruto... I'm... sorry...\NI-I did something uncalled for... Nah, it's okay. I...went and acted big. What should I do?\NI'm extremely stupid. Byakugan! Sharingan! I'll copy all his movements! My hand is moving fluently... I hit the jackpot straight away\Nwith this guy. Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh. I'm acknowledging that your smarts and the width of your forehead\Nare exceptional. So you should thank me. Thank me for getting to be\Nthe target for this Jutsu. Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu! So Ino... started using that Jutsu... There's no countering that spell of Ino's... Sakura, I let myself move\Ninto your mind for just a little bit. I have to memorize the answers quick. I've got to pass these answers\Nto Shikamaru and Choji. ♪ 59! Fails! ♪ 33! ♪9! This is the thirteenth group to fail. ♪ 41 fails. ♪ 35, ♪62 fails! No way! That brat... He coolly proceeds through this\Nruckus without moving an eyelash. Very well done considering he's new. The optic nerves are connected... The third eye... open! Ugh! There's dirt in my eye... Dang it...! Excuse me. What is it? I need to go to the bathroom... We will accompany you\Nto the bathroom. I see... Anyhow... the proctors are\Nnothing so special! They don't realize that the proctors\Nhave increased by one... Eh, don't you think so... Crow...? Forty minutes have passed\Nsince the test started... Twenty minutes left... huh... Since it's come to this, it's the last problem to be given\Nforty-five minutes after the start of the test. All there is to do is bet on this.\NBelieve it! Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life\Nonce I get it wrong?! Really? Really? Really? If I don't take it, I'll fail with\Nmy comrades immediately? No way, no way, no way. The hopeless rule for problem ten! Not good, not good, not good. No way can I choose which one! What to do, do, do, do. This is seriously, seriously bad! Bad, bad, bad, bad.

They're breathable and\Nmoisture-wicking, and perfectly designed for free movement,\Nall in a beautiful, stylish package. You'll notice a difference immediately\Nif you train with them on! They're going to grow on you! Before long, you'll be wanting to\Nwear them all the time like Lee! Of course, I have a thing for them, too! Woooow! Why couldn’t you bring a mirror\Nor something instead of carrying around\Nthose things, you dork! Do you think they'll look good on me? Don't even think about it.\NGet a load of that… Now that is truly dorky. Okay! This is the place! Here?! The gambling house frequented\Nby the entire town… Your target is Naruto, after all. To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority\Nplaced by our organization, Akatsuki! What's wrong? Pervy Sage… Why are they after me? You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?\NTell me why… They're not really after you…\NThey're after what's inside of you. What on earth is this thing? It's a horrible demon that\Nattacked Leaf Village, right? And was dreaded by all. So why do they want it so much? Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox\Nis a demon that appears at each critical juncture\Nthroughout the ages destroying everything in its path… And people feared it like\Nan act of nature. The reason they want that thing…\Nfor what purpose. Honestly, I can't quite say. Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox\Nis sealed up inside of you… they might be thinking\Nthey want that power in their control. It must be harsh to know that Ninja like them\Nwould keep coming after you… But well, that's your destiny! Now don’t you worry,\NI'm going to protect-- Then there's nothing to do\Nbut hurry up and get stronger! I've got to! Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person, have her save Sasuke\Nand get down to some serious training! That's just like this kid… A New Training Begins:\NI Will Be Strong! Th-This place has the highest antes…! Don't go fretting over\Nevery little thing! Let's go! Oh dear! Please wait! Hmm? What? The beautiful woman you\Nwant to ""research"" on… That's this Tsunade person? Whoa! That’s sharp coming from you!\NAnd what about it? She's part of the Sannin thing\Nlike you, right, Pervy Sage? Yes, and what of it? How…old is she? My age. Heck, she's an old lady. Yikes! Huh?! Th-This woman is…! Would you mind changing all\Nof this money into chips for me? Oh no! She's really going for it! Just who is this? This lady… You don't know? She's that woman with\Nthe famous alias… Famous alias…? So, well…what kind of person\Nis this Tsunade like? Oh, you want to know? Yeah. Let's see… Put simply, she's an unpleasant type. Besides that, she's a diehard gambler\Nand her face is known far and wide for it. Then we should have no problems\Nfinding her! If she's that famous! She's famous, all right…\NLegendary, you might say… Boss, what's this alias…? The Legendary… Legendary…? Oh dear! They're all laughing! – Legendary… 					– Legendary… Sitting Duck! Yup! But no matter how famous\NLegendary Sitting Duck is, I doubt we'll find her right away. Why not?! She hates growing old so much she's probably used some special Jutsu\Nto change her appearance. She's actually 50 years old, but no doubt she looks like\Nshe did when she was 20… And not just that,\Nrecently I heard that… she transforms into her teens or\N30s or 40s as the situation calls for to escape moneylenders. What?! That's a horrible thing to do! Tsunade has always loved\Nto gamble more than anything But she has terrible luck and no skill. She was always being played\Nfor the Sitting Duck and the name stuck… Then she was always borrowing money\Nand skipping out on her debts, too… Ah, it brings back memories. This is no time to be\Ngetting all nostalgic! Tell me, how do you propose\Nwe go about finding her?! Well… We may very well have to\Nput our noses to the ground, but we're not without our little tricks. What?! So you have no idea\Nhow long it's gong to take?! We won't be wasting any time.

Come on, Pervy Sage!\NLet's hurry up and start training! Now now, don't get ahead of yourself… The training won't mean anything unless it's done in the process of\Ngathering information on Tsunade. Huh? Gathering information…? In this town. Wow! Cool! This is my first time\Nfor this kind of thing! Down time is important, too! You go have yourself some fun\Nbefore we start training. The festival should continue\Nfor some time. We'll stay here in this city\Nfor the duration. We'll train here, too! All right! Whoa! That's a fat wallet!\NYou're rich! I have quite a bit! I've saved it little by little\Nthroughout my missions. Well then! – Wait! Naruto! 					– Huh? I'll hold on to your wallet for you! Wh-What do you think you're doing?! You can spend this much… What?! Only 300 ryo! No complaints! Remember Shinobi must honor\Nthe "" Shinobi’s Three Taboos""! Shinobi’s Three Taboos…?\NWhat's that? What?! You don't know! The ""three taboos"" are\Nthe three temptations that will bring Shinobi to ruin! The three temptations are\Nbooze, women and money… Oh, then this doesn't really apply\Nto me all that much! I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!\NI don't quite get the women thing! And I worked so hard\Nto save all that money, I don't really feel much like using it… You fool! Don't you underestimate\Nthe desire for money! Once you start using it,\Nit goes really fast! Money has a frightful power. This Tsunade we are going\Nto be looking for has ruined herself over it! Your desire for women is always\N getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage! I'm going on\Nan information-gathering mission! Here, you hold on to my bag for me! If you get lost, my tracking SummonsToad\Nwill follow my scent! He's really just a child after all,\Ncontrary to appearances… Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat! I’ll take one order of\Noctopus dumplings, sir! Right! – Potatoes with butter please!\N– You got it! – I want chocolate bananas.\N– Right! – I want apricot candy!\N– Thank you! – I want okonomiyaki too!\N– Here you go! Watch out, it's hot! One extra-large order\Nof fried noodle, sir! Right…But my you've got\Na lot of food there, young man! You don't plan\Nto eat it all yourself now, do you?! Eh? As a matter of fact,\NI am gong to eat it all myself. Oh, um, here you go… I think I ate a bit too much. I wonder how everyone is? Kakashi Sensei… Sasuke… Sakura… I'm going to train hard every day\Nand come back stronger. Just you wait and see! But before that…\NI better work off that meal! Last one! – All right! Perfect!\N– Oh! Amazing! That's the fruit of hard training\Nthrowing shuriken. You stink, sonny! Hah! Gosh darn it!\NWell, just watch this! Hold it! Huh? Attention: Shinobi!\NNinjutsu strictly forbidden! Thanks now! You shouldn't try to walk around\Nwith the mask on. It's Pervy Sage’s bank saving book. One, ten, one hundred… L-Look at all those zeros! He should be treating me now and then\Nif he has this much money. Stingy old geezer! There's only a little left… .\NOne more stand and that will be it… Time to make you strong…\NTraining! Two grilled squids please, sir!\NMake one of those an adult size! Okay! Someone sent you\Nto buy some squid, eh?! I'll throw in a child size for free!\NComing right up! Hurray for you, sir!\NYou're a man among men! Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!\NI'll give you the adult one for half price! Thanks! Good grief, where did he go to?! Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage? Young ladies are so nice. Oh, Naruto! You've already had\Nyou're fill of the festival? Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again! You're breaking all three at once!\NYou bastard! W-Wait, Naruto… N-No, I won't wait! You used all my hard-saved money! – Take this and this and this!\N– N-Naruto, stop! I'll pay it all back!\NI'm sorry, p-please! You! You!\NYou made my froggy wallet all flat! Hey! Look what you did, you urchin! You stained Leader's designer suit!\NYou'll have to pay for it! Fork over 100,000 ryo! What?! You're telling me\Nthat suit cost 100,000 ryo?! Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch to say a dorky suit like that\Ncost 100,000 ryo. Are you asking for it?! You better put a lid on it\Nif you know what's good for you. The leader used be a Chunin from\Nthe Hidden Village of Stones, the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all! Come again? Legendary what? You seem to want to get hurt! Naruto. Perfect timing. I'll show you a Jutsu now…\NWatch very carefully! Now you've done it! A-Amazing! I was holding back quite a bit…\NYou guys are so weak. A-Are you? The…legendary… I'm sorry…\NWe kind of destroyed your stand… H-Here… Fix it with this. Oh! Thanks. Would you mind if I bought all\Nyour balloons and water balloons at the same time, my man? Fine by me… That wasn’t an ordinary hand move… What in blazes was that?!\NThat Jutsu! Naruto! Come with me! It’s training time! Yes, sir! Finally, the mood is right\Nfor a little training. – Here! Water balloon!\N– Wha--? Eh?! What is it for?! You saw that Jutsu I just used, right? Y-Yeah. What Jutsu did it look like to you? It looked like you made\Nyour opponent spin violently. His perspective's off…\NBut I guess that's to be expected. Right, okay… Yes, spinning! He's spinning the water in the balloon\Nwithout moving his hand?! Whoa! The tree-climbing exercise to learn to gather and\Nmaintain Chakra in necessary places… The Walk-on-Water exercise to learn how to release\Na set amount of Chakra… You did both of these, right? And now with this water balloon exercise, you'll learn how to create\Na stream of Chakra… In other words, spinning. Create a stream of Chakra… I'll give a more detailed explanation\Nof the Jutsu once you get these first steps down. First, you must gather\Nand maintain Chakra in your hand using the tree-climbing technique. Then you must continuously\Nrelease Chakra using the Walk-on-Water technique. Then you push and churn the water\Nin the balloon with the Chakra! I get it! Then you spin the water\Nin the balloon faster and faster until the balloon pops! You're catching on\Nmore and more quickly! Okay, today we're going\Nto train until evening! Yes, sir! A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up\Nis the dream we've chosen, right? It's a secondary role, a role in the shadows But in reaching for that dream, let us stay centered,\Nlet us stay true Over and over,\Nwe hung on without giving up Over and over,\Nwe kept coming back up Over and over,\Nwe believed and dreamed Over and over,\Nwe've seen fools I will break this water balloon\Nno matter what!

Tenten vs. Temari The fifth battle… Tenten, Temari…come forward! Seeing that made me all fired up, too! Now…The second one from\Nthe Land of Sand, huh… Do your best! – Tenten!\N– It looks like it's going to be interesting. Begin! Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru Go for it, Tenten! Believe in your own strength, Tenten! We’re behind you, Tenten! Knock her with all your strength! That’s good! Cheer her on more, more,\Nmore with passion, Lee! Yeah! These guys are noisy! That spacing is just what I’d expect\Nfrom Tenten, not too close, not too far. Attacks or defense,\Nshe can respond to either one. What happened? Please begin. Are you planning to wait out and\Nsee how I make my move? Let me just tell you, once I start my attack\Nyou’ll be over in a second. You’re trying to be cool and\Nsee what I do first… A hundred years too early! It doesn’t matter to me, come first. You said it… Well, I won’t hold back. They missed? That’s impossible! What happened?\Nls that a warm-up? Or are you scared and your aim is off? I thought I would enjoy it\Na little bit more, but evidently it’s not promising. No way! I can’t believe Tenten’s attack missed! It’s unbelievable indeed. Tenten’s weapons... always hits the mark\Nten out of ten times. There no reason for them to miss. That’s right...\NShe didn’t miss. She was made to miss. As always, she’s being disagreeable. How foolish… How disgraceful! Huh? Sand wins again. We don’t know that yet. We know. How? 					How do we know? Explain it so I understand! Stupid... As if I'd do\Nsuch a bothersome thing. Shikamaru said it so,\Nsurely that’s how it is. These guys are hard to understand. Calm down… Don’t let her get to you… One. Two. Three… If it’s gonna get dodged, I just have to make\Nit impossible to! So she’s measuring the spacing,\Nnext one is going to be the big attack. I get it… So, that fan is the secret. If so… How about…this?! No way! My flying weapons! Is there a secret mechanism\Nin the fan…? This is… the first star. There are two more. When the third star appears, you will lose. Tenten! Don’t be taken in by\Nyour opponent, be calm! Be calm! I know… Lee, I really intended to use\Nthis in the main battle, not the preliminary round-- but it looks like I can’t do it that way. She’s already going to use it? Pulling out two scrolls? What does she intend to do? Hah! No matter what you do,\Nit won’t work. Rising Twin Dragons! Even if you increase the amount,\Nit’s still the same! Second star! I’m not done yet! Did I do it? Third star. She disappeared! Where is she? I’m over here! Darn--! Ninja Art! Wind Scythe Jutsu! Tenten! Chakra is enfolded in that wind. Huh?! Tenten fought well… But she won’t be able to escape from\Nthat twister. T-That’s awful. Tenten…! How boring... really. To think she completely intercepted\NTenten’s weapon attacks. This is ridiculous! What’s going on with her…? It’s just like Shikamaru said,\Nit’s the Sand’s win. That’s why I said it. There’s no reason for us to lose here. The Land of Sand is to be feared… Temari wins the fifth battle. Oh no! Nice catch. What are you doing?! Is that something you do to\Nan opponent who fought to the utmost?! You’re annoying! Take that trash away already! Stop! Lee! Leaf Hurricane! What?! You’re just like you look… You’re dull too. What did you say?! Stop! Lee! Guy Sensei! Temari. Come up quick, you’ve been\Ndeclared the winner. Don’t keep company with that awful-looking\Nguy and his chaperone forever. What…?! That’s enough, Lee. Gentlemen of Sand… I wonder if I may give you\Na word of warning. This kid is strong. You should prepare yourselves. Picking a fight with the Sand… I absolutely wouldn't want to\Ndo it with those guys. T-They’re all awesome guys… Don’t lose to those guys! Naruto! S-Sakura. Sakura… Are you okay already? Never mind that,\Nyou should worry about yourself! Huh? Me? I don’t have\Nan injury or anything. That’s not what I mean. If you lose here, it’s a point of dishonor. You’d be ashamed to face Sasuke! Y- Yeah. And… Thanks for earlier… No! Sakura! You did your hardest\Nto get here! You’ll disgrace women if\Nyou lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl! If it weren’t for your stupid cheering\Nat that time… I would have been soundly\Nbeaten by Ino. Yeah, that's right. Y-You! Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next! Next! 					Next is my turn! Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin Darn! It’s me. Shikamaru, don’t lose! – Show us that you’re a real man!\N– All right, all right. Get her with the 16 combo, go! – Win Shikamaru!\N– Ino’s become super energetic. You go for it! That guy manipulates shadows. Be careful of the shadows… I won’t be beaten by\Na stupid technique like that. Shikamaru! Bash that one around!\NAnd while you're at it... Man, what a pain. Furthermore, my opponent is a woman…\Nlt's hard to get to it. If that’s what you think,\NI’ll end this quickly. Go, go! Shikamaru! Well, you could say that\NI know these guys’ raw power from that incident from the second test… I don’t know anything about this one’s Jutsu. On top of that, she’s seen my Jutsu… – The sixth battle.\N– That being said, for me… Shikamaru versus Kin! Begin! I can only do this. One trick pony, huh…? Shut up! Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu! That Jutsu! It’s nothing if I just pay attention\Nto the movement of your shadow! Bells…? Heh, that’s a classic. Next, you’ll throw Senbons with bells and Senbons without bells\Nat the same time, right? I’ll respond to the sound of the bells,\Nintending to dodge them. But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,\Nand, ouch. Is that right? You’re a chatty guy! So in order to not get caught\Nby the shadow Senbons… I'm alert to the trick\Nand look closely… What?! Behind?! String? Darn it! Too late! Shikamaru! He took that pretty bad. It wasn’t tat bad, look closely. Huh? F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit. Now it’s my turn! That’s not going to happen. W-What’s this? That happens to anyone\Nwho hears my bell. The sound vibration of\Nthis special bell reaches the brain directly\Nfrom the ear drum. And then it will make you hallucinate. It’s useless! You can’t avoid the sound of\Nmy bell by doing... that... that... that... that... that... Shoot! Which one?\NWhich is the real one? You can’t do anything, can you? Your shadow, which was your faint hope,\Ndoesn’t even know where to stretch to… Well… I’ll cook you slowly. Taking me lightly…! This time it’s five,\Nnext time seven… I’ll continue until you become\Na hedgehog. Y-You’re lying, you brat! Huh?! You’d end it soon… That’s what you said\Nin the beginning, isn’t it? I see, you can’t endure the pain\Nand want to be eased. Well, I’ll finish it here. It’s your death warrant. W-What?! M-My body… At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu\Nis a success. W-What are you saying? No way!\NYour shadow isn’t anywhere... You don’t realize it yet? I-It can’t be… It's just that, you fool! A thread at this height\Ncan’t have a shadow. I can stretch and shrink\Nmy own shadow. The shadow is gradually getting thicker. This wasn’t the shadow of the thread… That's right. I stretched my shadow\Nand made it narrow, so it looked like the shadow of\Na thread and stuck it on you. But… How do you win with that? I’m just gonna move\Nthe same way as you. Annoying. Be quiet and watch. Stupid! If you continue like this and attack… You, too, 					will be wounded! I know that. No way! You're...! We’re gonna throw shuriken\Nat each other. How far will we go…? Fool, stop it! You're only talk... And that one's a goner. If you’re a shinobi, you have to grasp the situation\Nand the layout when you battle. Even though we made\Nthe same movements… the distance of the walls behind\Neach of us was different. I just used the shuriken and called attention away\Nfrom the wall behind us. Winner! Shikamaru Nara. Good job Shikamaru! Cool! Me next… Me next… Me next…! That guy’s dull and plain,\Nbut that was kinda cool. Shoot! I’m the only one left. And the next match. The people left are one Sound ninja, me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee. And that Sand guy… Just please spare me from that guy. This year’s rookie looks quite challenging… Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka It’s here, it’s here, it’s here! What we’ve been waiting for! It’s finally my turn! Yeah! Lucky us! If it’s this guy\Nwe’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!

B-Bushy Brows… Lee…\NCould he have lost consciousness…? Tenten! Neji! Raiga! Turn around! What…? That voice right now…? Wha–?! Raiga! Ranmaru! This is… Neji… Ranmaru! Move! Huh? Somehow…it felt like\NI was fighting in my dreams… Ranmaru… You! Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives! Naruto… Just die already… Hey! I have something\NI want to ask you!

It’s fine…\Nlf I am going to be killed by you. Huh…?\NWhy is it fine for me to kill you…? You were…always crying… Huh? Me…cry? In your heart…\Nseeking the meaning of living. I was always watching…you. What…are you? I am the same as you…\Nliving is painful. I don’t understand\Nthe meaning of living. Because of my sickness,\NI couldn’t go outside… Shunned by everyone, all I could do was to take\Na peek of the world from this blanket… But …if with my death, if you are able to feel\Nthe meaning of life even a little… My life was not needed\Nfrom the beginning. Please… Are you…alone? Come with me. From now on,\Nyou and I are two as one. From that day on,\NI became Raiga’s eyes and ears. Raiga became my hands and feet. The outside world that I dashed\Ninto for the very first time… it was filled with things\NI had never seen or heard before. It was fun. Whenever and wherever,\NI was with Raiga. No matter when it was, there wasn’t a time\Nthat we were separated. We were trying to find the meaning of life\Nby living for each other. We were convinced that\Nwas the meaning to living. That’s why… If Raiga is not around, I no longer have the power\Nto live by myself. I’ve lost the purpose to live… Do you have someone\Nprecious to you? I want to protect\Nsomeone important to me… I want to make his dream come true,\Nand that’s my dream. Often people have it wrong… mistakenly believing that showing mercy\Nto an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe\Nwhose life is in their hands. It’s not mercy to me at all… Do you know the agony of just living\Nwithout dreams and being unwanted? What are you saying? Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.\NYou’ve taken away my reason for living. I no longer need to live. Don’t say such stupid things. Naruto… Please kill me! Huh? What are you doing? Now, quickly. Why are you hesitating…? With my arms and legs torn apart,\NI have no means to resist, you know. You should carry out your mission…. Hurry and deliver your finishing blow. Our mission is to force out\Nthe Kurosuki Family from this village… Without Raiga, he cannot be\Nof any threat to this village. The problem right now is that the Kurosuki Family members\Nhave lost their leadership. Once the hoop comes off,\Nwe don’t know what they will do. For this mission…\Nthis is the finishing touch. Yeah, but what are we\Ngoing to do with him? Is he a villain worth tying up? No, he is not. He might kill himself, right? Once the mission is over,\Nwe will come save you right away… A Chakra Sealing tag? We can’t help it.\NHe is an enemy, after all… We should assume he has other Jutsu.\NJust in case! So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here?

117,"Connecting old words\Nthat have been used up I just want to convey\Nmy simple thoughts That day's faint wind blows away at the castle ruins of yesterday I'll laugh with you\Nand live for the moment Still that incident\Nwill continue to trouble you, right? That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away Heh! It’s over… Losing is not an Option What?! Just barely… That was a close one. But…I was able to throw it off\Njust a little. There’s no mistake. He’s now realized the secret\Nof the Byakugan. What’s the meaning of this?\NHow?! How was he able to throw it a whole six inches\Nfrom his vital point?! I see… That Chakra! He was emitting Chakra\Nthe whole time and covered the area surrounding him! And in a wide range to that extent. No wonder he was able\Nto detect the arrow and throw off the trajectory of it. But constantly emitting that\Nmuch Chakra is a death throe… If he doesn’t go that far,\Nhe can’t dodge. In other words, there’s no mistake. It’s as I hypothesized… The arrow earlier was\Ntotally invisible to him! He doesn’t carry out useless attacks… And from the results,\Nhe accurately examines the information. And…he’s also discovered\Nthe weakness of my eyes… Impressive. Of all the enemies\NI’ve fought until now, this guy’s the strongest! He has 360-degree sight. And he unfailingly detects attacks that penetrate the roughly\N150-feeot circumference around him. But for some reason, there were Kunai Knives\Nhe couldn’t evade completely. Why couldn’t he evade them? Because he couldn’t see them! In other words, even his Visual Jutsu\Nhas a slight blind spot! Being unable to see Kunai Knives\Nentering that blind spot, he’s unable to react. So he was dealing with attacks\Nfrom the blind spot with that defense technique. And I analyzed all the attacks\NI carried out and grasped them perfectly. Right behind his first thoracic vertebra… there exists a blind spot expanding\Nfrom a very small point. Indeed, if he moves and\Ndoesn’t stabilize the blind spot, it becomes difficult to aim there\Nwith an arrow. But such a trick…doesn’t fool me! Gentle Fist is pointless if\Nyou don’t come close to your enemy. And you can’t afford to think about\Napproaching me at this point. It’s about how to escape now… Though whether you struggle or not,\Nyou’re going to die anyway. Heh… It seems you only\Nhave a little Chakra left. The fate of the small fry character\Nin an easy game is to be destroyed right away! It’s useless! A thread?! I see, with this thread… This time, the trajectory was thrown off\Nslightly by the trees, huh? If that’s the case… I’ll add some rotation this time. So even if it hits a tree, it’ll just cut through and the trajectory\Nwon’t be thrown off. And as before… I’ll control the arrow up until\N150 feet away from him using a thread with Chakra\Nflowing through. I’ll take aim at the moving target… and plunge the arrow into\Nthe blind spot with a pinpoint attack! He’s still standing up? He’s strong…\NHe’s much stronger than me. I hardly have any Chakra left now. I probably won’t be able to evade\Nhis next attack completely. Is this it? I’ll win no matter what! Naruto… I wonder what you’d do. I’ve had enough. I can’t dodge it anyway. He’s stopped moving…\NHas he given up? But just to make doubly sure… Maximum destructive power\Nwith 120% accuracy. I’ve got him! This is it. Gentle Fist! Wh-What? He still…?! No! My attack just now\Nshould’ve made the kill. Substance with Chakra base… It’s meaningless against Gentle Fist. Gentle Fist… I see, in his final moments, he funneled the last Chakra\Nthrough the thread! Eight crows… Again I couldn’t see one of them. What happened to him? He damaged several of\Nmy internal organs. But…I can still move. You failure… I told you… I don’t know when to quit! Why do you try to go against\Nyour destiny that much? Because I was called…a failure! But if you’re going to say it’s futile,\Nyou don’t have to do anything! After I become the Hokage,\NI’ll change Hyuga! The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh? I was careless… Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu\NI stunk at. Don’t be whining about boring stuff\Nlike destiny and what not, and how it can’t be changed! Unlike me, you're not a failure. Naruto… Now it’s become the three of us… Don’t worry about such things. Both Choji and Neji will\Ncatch up right away. Choji had the trump card. And I’ve fought Neji\Nin the Chunin exam, so I know… Know what? That he’s…a true genius. Believe it! I cannot lose… Whether he’s an enemy\Nmuch stronger than me… or even if this body should fail me… I cannot lose! I have a reason why I cannot lose! I’ve had a hard time of it this time. I played too long… Huh? I can’t build up Chakra… How? You should’ve\Nbeen instantly killed! How come you’re alive?! I couldn’t completely\Nevade it anyway. So I was prepared to deliberately\Ntake the hit. And I knew of my own weakness\Nmuch more than you do… There were eight crows, huh? This Byakugan has a blind spot. However, if I knew that your attack\Nwould only come from there… I could release my Chakra just\Nto that blind spot and detect the attack. It’s not so difficult to make a move of just a few inches\Nto throw off the aim. I’d suffer a serious injury,\Nbut instant death can be avoided. So you took the hit deliberately…? It doesn’t change the fact\Nthat you’re going to die here. How can you go that far?! “Of all the enemies,”\Nyou’re the strongest I’ve ever fought… But, there’s a reason why I cannot lose. Of all those I’ve ever fought,\Nthe strongest one said this to me… – Unlike me…you are not a failure!\N– Unlike me…you are not a failure! He said that. I’ve been called a genius all along. So I cannot lose. And for the sake of those guys\Nwho believe that this humdrum and small me\Nis a genius! “The fate of the small fry character\Nin a game is to be destroyed right away.” You said that, didn’t you? Look at this situation! Things like fate,\Nisn’t determined by someone! I wonder… You also look like\Nyou’re going to die! Neji, live. More than anyone in the clan, you’re the man loved most\Nby the Hyuga ability… I cannot die so easily. Even if you act tough,\Nyou can’t stem the current now… Master Sasuke ran to\Nthe Sound Village by his own wish. Sasuke is now in the darkness… No… Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me. There’s a person who can find him\Nin the darkness and save him. Master Sasuke belongs\Nto Lord Orochimaru. No matter who it may be,\Nthey can’t save… He can save him!

To think that they could outwit Anbu… They're not just ordinary… What are you doing here?!\NLord Hokage is in danger! What a nuisance… To think that the enemy was\Nmasquerading as our Anbu… So it was also that guy\Nwho used Genjutsu! Yeah…there’s no mistake. I didn’t expect that… Sand Village would betray Leaf Village. The treaty is simply a camouflage to\Nmake the enemy let down their guard. The petty little battle game ends now. From this point on, the course\Nof history will change! Are you saying that\Nyou’re starting a war? That’s right. One should avoid resolution\Nthrough armed force and should rather seek\Na solution through negotiations. There’s still time…Lord Kazekage! Perhaps one gets addicted to\Npeace as one grows older… Sarutobi Sensei! You’re… Just my bad luck… to have lookout duty\Non a day like this. I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too. Stop fussing. The Chunin Exam takes\Nplace twice a year. You’ll have many more chances\Nto see it. But this year, that kid from\Nthe Uchiha Clan is taking part, right? And I won’t have\Na chance to see that… I won’t be able to die peacefully. What’s that?! It’s time! Begin! The Summoning has succeeded. Huge boa! Notify Lord Hokage immediately! I’m not letting you in the village! Dispatch the reinforcements immediately! Yes sir! Sand Ninja! What’s going on? Stop that, Gaara! I’ll kill him…! There’s no meaning in\Ncontinuing this fight! Don’t forget our mission! Out of my way…! What are you guys doing?! The operation is already underway! What in the world is going on? Gaara! What’s the matter?! His wound is deeper than\NI thought! And moreover his Chakra\Nis pretty drained! In that case,\Nwhat about using that thing…? That’s impossible to do right away! Idiot! It’s all because\Nyou didn’t wait for the signal and tried to become\Nthe Perfect Possession… What should we do?! Are you saying we have to do\Nthis without Gaara? Isn’t Gaara here yet?! Gaara is Sand’s trump card. We have to get Gaara to do his work,\Nno matter what! You guys leave for the moment and\Ntend to Gaara’s wounds! As soon as Gaara’s Chakra has\Nbeen restored… the operation will recommence! Got it! What about you, Sensei?! I’m gonna suppress those guys! Do you think things will\Ngo according to your plan? I’ll make them so… Go! Okay! Is Orochimaru the host of this party? Dunno… In any case,\Nlet’s heat this thing up. Sasuke… Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here. You’ve already achieved Chunin level. If you’re a Leaf Shinobi,\Nbe of service to the Leaf! In other words, I’m supposed to\Ntake down that jerk Gaara, right? A continuation of earlier on, right? Don’t pursue too far. From here on, it’s no longer an exam.\Nlt’s the real thing! What I have to do though…\Nis the same! I won’t let him through! Sasuke…! Boy oh boy… We intended to take Sasuke\Nwhile Gaara was causing the trouble. But not everything goes as planned. I see… Is that so? So Leaf Village and…\NSasuke were the target, huh? Is the Leaf such a big catch? More importantly,\Nif Gaara wakes up, I’ll be able to show you something\Nmuch more interesting. Well, anyway… Your thick-headedness has caused\Nthe Leaf to be outmaneuvered. It’s my win. Nothing is decided\Nuntil the very end. I believe that’s what I taught you… Orochimaru. I thought this day would\Neventually arrive. However… You won’t get my head that easily! I told you, didn’t I? It is preferable to decide\Nthe Fifth Hokage quickly… Third Hokage… because you will…die here. I wonder how the Chunin Exams\Nare going? I wonder if Naruto’s match is over yet? The first match was\Nwith Neji, right? I want him to win that\Nmatch somehow or other. That’s no good! A teacher mustn’t root for\None particular student! All the graduating students\Nare dear to him! I must root for all of them equally! But I still…want Naruto to win… Are you worried about Naruto? Well, of course…! As I thought… Y-You guys… I told you to do ten laps around\Nthe school grounds, didn’t I?! We finished that long ago. While you were daydreaming, Sensei. When our teacher is in that state,\Nhe can’t teach a class! So let’s call it quits for today! N-No, no!\NI’m continuing with class. I wonder what that smoke is…? That’s coming from the direction\Nof the exam arena… Isn’t there some disturbance\Nto the east? I wonder if something happened? That Orochimaru… What should we do? Should we send reinforcements? No… It’s dangerous to make a move\Nwhen we don't really know what the situation is. If the mastermind is Orochimaru… even more so. Is Orochimaru…\Nthat dangerous a guy? Originally…he was a student\Nof the Third Hokage. So why did he become a Rogue Ninja? Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage\Nwas decided… Orochimaru apparently asserted that\Nhe was capable of taking on that role. But his request was denied. And shortly afterwards,\Nthat guy slipped out of this village. Orochimaru most likely holds\Na grudge against the Third Hokage because of that. Revenge…is it? Probably. Long ago, when I was a kid… there’s one thing I remember\Nthinking when I saw that guy… That he didn’t seem human… That he seems to be something\Nthat just took on a human form… Frightening… Simply…frightening. Reporting! A large boa has appeared near\Nthe eastern gate of the Leaf Village! And behind it, some one hundred\NSand Ninja are infiltrating the country! They are currently engaged in\Narmed conflict with our Shinobi who were patrolling nearby! The Sand…?! Leave Squad One and Two behind\Nand make for the eastern gate. Immediately! – Yes sir! 					– Yes sir! We won’t let you past this point! There’s quite a large number. We were careless! And even Lord Hokage has been… Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier! Yeah. What…? Orochimaru! Orochimaru?! Why is that guy…? Don’t tell me that\Nthey’re after Sasuke again?! Sasuke! Huh? He’s not there…? Sakura, stay there for a while. I’m gonna go reduce\Nthe number of enemies. Darn! I’m worried about\NLord Hokage, but… Leave above to Anbu. Besides… Lord Hokage isn’t the kind of guy\Nwho can be taken down that easily. But… After all, he is the Hokage of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. Are you so happy, you’re crying? Or… do you have an iota of sadness\Nin your heart to kill me, your teacher? No… Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy… but I’m finally awake. That’s what I thought. I know you aren’t someone\Nwho would hold a grudge. You have neither a goal nor motive. Hmm… I guess… I do kind of have a goal. If I were to explain it… It’s interesting to watch things\Nthat move. I get no pleasure if\Nsomething doesn’t move. Like a windmill that doesn’t turn… Well, it may have some kind\Nof appeal once in a while. But usually,\Nit’s not worth looking at it. Right now…with a wind called\N“Destroy the Leaf Village,” I want to turn that windmill. You’re the same as always… Sakura! It was worth teaching you Genjutsu\Nsurvival training during the Genin Exam. You truly have a talent for it. Huh? Release the Genjutsu and\Nwake up Naruto and Shikamaru! Naruto will be delighted. He’ll be getting a mission\Nafter such a long while.

This time it's aiming for my real body… But... It's not so easy! A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow! This is... The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu! A second Shuriken in his blind spot! But... Still too naïve. He dodged it! Here it is! Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior! You little brat! Kakashi Sensei! Naruto... Your strategy was outstanding. You've grown up…\NBoth of you. The purpose of the Shadow Clones\Nwas not to take down Zabuza, but to hide my transformation\Ninto Demon Wind Shuriken! I left one clone behind, then\Ntransformed into Demon Wind Shuriken. Then a clone threw the real me, who had\Ntransformed into Demon Wind Shuriken, towards Sasuke! Sasuke! When Sasuke got me, he must have realized\Nright away who I was. Then he took out his own Shuriken... And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu! Demon Wind Shuriken… Windmill of Shadows! Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken,\NI aimed for Zabuza. Of course I didn't think\N I would defeat Zabuza! But I thought I'd destroy\Nthe Water Prison. And as a bonus\NI defeated his water clone, too… It was a huge success! That was a fluke… It was a fluke, huh! Still, they performed oustandingly\Nin tandem… in this desperate situation. Despite the fact… that those two always\Nfight like cats and dogs.

Close your Byakugan, Hinata! Kiba, restrain Akamaru’s\Nsense of smell! –What?! 					–What is it?! It’s because we’re caught\Nin someone’s Jutsu. Say what?! Yes. We’re now inside\NYakumo’s Genjutsu. It may seem as if the Leaf Village\Nwas in a war. But this is merely\Na part of her Genjutsu. This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu\Nand we’ve all been trapped in it? That’s totally impossible! But if her latent powers have awakened,\Nit wouldn’t be hard at all. This whole village?! This ground we’re standing on,\Nthis sky, everything is Genjutsu?! There are occasions when\Nsuperior senses become a hindrance. It’s because no matter how superior\Nthe sense of sight or smell might be, ultimately it’s the human brain that\Nprocesses and perceives the information! There are times when\Nwell-developed brains make errors in the process of interpreting\Ncomplex electric signals. However, insects act only\Nwith sharp senses. Unlike the information processed\Nwith a human brain, insects narrow this information down\Nto the very minimum. Look. My insects\Nare still under control. They will not be deceived. There are occasions when Yakumo’s Genjutsu\Nsummons thunderclouds and produces fire. And that is planted directly into\Nthe human brain as if it had occurred in reality. And that causes the brain\Nto hurt one’s own body. Then, Grandma’s house… That’s also Yakumo’s power?! It’s not just that… She can even kill people easily\Nif she were so inclined. But these tremors… Are you saying this is also Genjutsu? You’ll see any moment now… A-A snake! It’s too huge! Is that also Genjutsu?! It’s a terrifying image that\Nour cerebrums have created. Physical influence is absolutely… unthinkable! No way! Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?! Huh?! Really…? Yakumo can kill people\Nwith Genjutsu..? So is that why the Third Hokage\Ntried to eliminate her? Yakumo, Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei… Over here… Kurenai Sensei… I still can’t believe it. To think Yakumo would do\Nsomething like that! Once every several generations, a child is born into our Kurama Clan\Nwith physical idiosyncrasies. That child is Yakumo… Moreover, what’s terrifying is her\Nusing her powers unconsciously without being able to control it. It’s getting kind of hot. Don’t! What’s happening\Noutside the door…? Don’t open it! Wh-What’s this…? Why’s there lava here…? That’s an illusion our brains have\Ncreated due to Yakumo’s Genjutsu. But even it’s an illusion,\Nif we were to dive into the lava, our brains would determine it to be lava\Nand our bodies would burn up. That is Yakumo’s power. So is that why Old Man Hokage\Nand Kurenai Sensei tried to eliminate Yakumo? That’s not it. What they really\Nattempted to kill was the monster\Nexisting inside Yakumo. A monster? Before too long,\NYakumo’s massive powers created a terrifying monster. If left alone, the monster that\Ncontinues to grow would someday attempt to\Nbecome one with her by absorbing\NYakumo’s consciousness. The Third Hokage and Kurenai\Ndetermined as such and all there was to do in order\Nto save Yakumo was to seal her powers. A monster in her body… So that’s what it was… I can’t just sit back like this! Oh! Oh. My entire fortune! I told you. If you dive into the lava,\Nyou’re body will really burn up. Then does that mean\Nwe can’t get out of here?! No, there is one way. What’s that way?! If you seal your five senses,\Nthe Genjutsu cannot affect the body. You must escape from this world\Nand attack Yakumo! What?! Attack Yakumo?! Ow-ow-ow! What? This is…Satomi Hill?! Old Man Unkai!

Tell me the truth… It was the Third Hokage who ordered\Nmy father and mother killed and the Kurama Clan and me eliminated\Nfrom the Leaf Village, right? No. The Third Hokage did not order\Nsuch a mission… Why do you lie?! Please. Tell me the truth! You’ll vanish if you don’t,\NKurenai Sensei… Such a sad child… If killing me will eliminate your suffering,\Nthen you should do it. If your hate will vanish along\Nwith your suffering! Why do you cry?\NI won’t be deceived by tears like that! 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005! Yeah, it feels good in\Nevery kind of weather to sweat.

I’ve only been away for a week, but it seems as though\Nan awful lot has changed. DOJO CHALLENGERS,\NCOME THIS WAY\N		That sign wasn’t here before, either. Dojo challenge?

You’ve come here\Nfor a Dojo challenge, right? Well, then.\NCome at me from anywhere you like! Huh? Bushy Brow? If you don’t make a move,\NI’m coming at you! What? Wait, hold it. Hey, it’s me!\Nlt’s only me, Bushy Brow! Naruto! Hey, that was close, I tell you! So the first Dojo challenger\Nwill be you, Naruto! Well, I couldn’t wish for\Na better opponent! Huh? I’m going to go at this for real! W-Wait just a minute! Leaf Hurricane! Here… So you just came to view the grounds? Then you should have said so\Nin the first place. I never even got a chance to tell you.\NYou just suddenly attacked me. I’m really sorry about that. Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow? Yes. I have been working on it\Nfor quite some time and finally completed it 6 days ago. This flyer was distributed\Nnot only in Hidden Leaf Village, but in all the nearby\Ntowns and villages as well. You don’t say? I’ve been away on a mission\Nand have only just returned… Is that so? But why a Dojo? It’s all for training. For training? Well, actually, I’ve been busy\Nwith missions lately and have not been able to set aside\Nas much time for training as I’d like to. And even on those occasions when\NI was able to take time out… it was difficult to find practice partners,\Nso I wasn’t able to train efficiently. Just when I was wondering\Nwhat I ought to do about it YOUTH\N		I saw something in a village\N		I visited on a mission… I request a challenge! Please come this way. Okay… I have traveled near and far\Nin search of training… I’d like to have a practice match. But if I should win,\NI’ll claim your marquee. A Dojo challenge, huh?\NVery well, I shall have a match with you. Here I come! If I were to open my own Dojo, someone with confidence in his skills\Nwill surely come to challenge me! So, I opened the Dojo thinking\Nit would give me good practice, but nobody has come\Nto challenge me yet… Hmmm… Is that so? Say, since you’re here, Naruto,\Nwon’t you try out for a Dojo challenge? If you win,\NI’ll give you the sign I painted myself. I have no need for such things. Don’t say that!\NPlease, by all means! C-Come to think of it,\NI forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade! I’d better go right away! See you later! Naruto! Please be my first! Damn it. I wasted so much time\Nthanks to Bushy Brow. Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits. I’d better steer clear of Bushy Brow’s Dojo\Nfor the time being. What’s that I hear about Lee’s Dojo? Intense Brow Sensei…? Naruto, what do you mean by that? Do you mean to tell me\Nthat he opened a Dojo to train himself while I was away from the village\Non a mission? Splendid, if I may say so\Nabout my own student! I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved! But the all-important Dojo challengers\Nare yet to appear… Not a single one. Damn those Dojo challengers! To think that Lee’s earnest hopes\Nhave come to naught… I’ll search high and low\Nand give them a hit they can not forget! But, if you do that, you’ll just make even less people\Nwant to visit for a challenge. Ah, that’s right…\NWhatever shall I do then?! I’ve got it. If no one come\Nto challenge his Dojo, then… Why don’t I myself go to Lee’s Dojo,\Ndisguised as a Dojo challenger? I’ll play the part of Lee’s first! A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself. He wouldn’t dream that\Nthis was me, no way. Here I come, Lee. Guy Sensei! I finally found you. If it isn’t Sakura!\NWhat is going on? Guy, forgive me for bothering you\Nwhen you’ve only just returned, but… an emergency relief request has come in\Nfrom Shikamaru’s squad, which was assigned to\Ntransport unit duty. We know nothing whatsoever about\Nthe true nature and scale of the enemy. Therefore… there is a possibility of this developing\Ninto something major if we err in our initial encounter. Judging from reports,\Nthey should be around here. They’re close by. First, you go reconnoiter\Nto confirm the situation. If they seem to need additional relief,\NI will make immediate arrangements. Yes, roger that. Can that strange getup\Nhave some significance? I don’t know… What’s with that strange fellow? Well, no matter.\NI’ll borrow his form to infiltrate Leaf Village. The Village Hidden in the Leaves’\Nsecrets… I, Nanafushi,\Nshall investigate every last detail! Was that guy really\Nlooking for a Dojo challenge? Yeah. That’s what he claimed to be,\Nso there can be no doubt. He says he came\Nbecause he saw the flyers. I wonder if he got lost or something… Intense Brow Sensei, how long\Ndo you intend to keep us waiting? Naruto, I think, after all, I’d like\Nto have you be a Dojo challenger… Oh no. I’ll go look for him! Naruto! Let’s work up a youthful sweat with me! Oh, he returned after all. I knew that get up would be problematic. What? 					What’s the problem? Huh? Sensei…?\NWhat’s with the strange disguise? Everyone can still tell it’s you! I…I didn’t think it was\Nsuch a great idea, either. What’s the matter? Don’t tell me these guys\Nhave discovered my true identify! Intense Brow Sensei! Sensei! Oh! Quit lollygagging\Nand get over to Lee's Dojo! Huh?! If you don’t go, then I’ll have to fight him!\NCome on! Be seeing you…! I guess you could say… That’s typical of him… I’m safe thanks to this guy… I should attach myself to him for a while\Nand scope out the situation in the village. What is this place? This is Lee’s Dojo! But, really… Couldn’t you have\Ncome up with a little better disguise? Well, never mind! Lee must be tired of waiting,\Nso try to do a good acting job! Acting?\NWhat is he talking about? I’ve brought him with me, Bushy Brow! I’ve been waiting for you…! Well then, please try to take down my Dojo! Huh…? Please come this way! Um…um. At time like this, you're supposed to say,\N“I request a challenge match,” right? I-I see… I-I request a challenge match! Do I hear that familiar call?\NYou indeed are a Dojo challenger! Fair enough! If you win,\Nyou can have my marquee! Could it be that I’ve been\Nmistaken for a Dojo challenger? Oh my god… Huh?! He’s just a kid… Well, it can’t be helped.\NI’ll go easy on him… Okay! Here I come! – Ready! 					– Huh? He disappeared? Huh…? Wh-What happened…? This little brat…! Take that! And that!\NAnd this! And that! He's strong! What’s going on?! I know you’re only acting, but you’re still\Ngiving him too much of a break, Sensei. Oh, I see. He’s not fighting back because\Nit’ll ruin his disguise! Even if I had nine lives,\NI’d never survive this fellow… I think I’d better wave a white flag\Nand withdraw here. I-I concede… Then that means…I did it! I splendidly fought off\Nmy first Dojo challenger! No, that’s not it at all! What he means by “concede” is that he concedes\Nto be a Dojo challenger, right? In other words,\Nhe’s just been warming up, and now comes\Nthe real challenge, right? No, that’s not it at all! So that's what you meant, after all… I thought it was odd that that an experienced Dojo challenger\Nwould surrender. It’s not odd!\NThere’s nothing odd about it at all! Well, then, I’ll have to really\Nget down to business now, too! What?! You mean you haven’t even\Nreally gotten started yet? Hey! Intense Brow Sensei\Nis a pretty good actor! He’s even taking more hits so that\NBushy Brow won't know it's him. What?\NYou were only attacked by monkeys? They were after the snacks\Nthat Choji procured but the important load is safe! My snacks… by a monkey… Ino mistook that for\Nan enemy’s attack and sent out\Nan emergency relief request. But, it was so sudden! Anyway, it’s your fault\Nfor procuring so many snacks! These snacks were available\Nonly for a limited time, and moreover,\Nonly available in the Land of Tea, the Super-rare\N“Green tea Pork-flavored” chips! For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin\Nto refrain from buying a limited offering of snacks\Nonce one has found them! Like I care about stuff like that! What? What?! Shikamaru, things are tough for you,\Naren't they? Right back at you. That getup…\NDid something happen? Huh? What about my getup…? Here. Oh, that’s right!\NI haven’t got time for dallying here! I’ve got to get over to Lee’s dojo! Just wait for me, Lee! You’re overdoing\Non purposefully getting beaten, Sensei… Is he finished now? Whoa, hold it! Time out! Fight back a little, will you?! It’s impossible, I tell you. If Lee doesn’t\Nfind this challenging enough, I might get stuck being his opponent. Actually… It’s been one extreme mission\Nafter another lately, and I haven’t gotten any sleep at all… What? You don’t say… If I got a little rest,\NI think I might recover, but… While I take a rest,\Nwon’t you be his opponent for a while? What?! I’m begging you! Wh-What is that? I’m coming, Lee! G-Guy? I thought he already entered the village\Na while ago… S-Sorry to keep you waiting! You've weathered such an attack\Nand you're still undamaged… You’re quite a fellow! The world is vast… To think that such\Nan awesome Dojo challenger exists! It was worth building this Dojo! There’s no way I could win\Nwith only Taijutsu! If that’s the case,\Nthen I’ll fight my own way… Here I come! Shadow Clone Jutsu! But, of course! He’s well acquainted\Nwith Ninjutsu too! Leaf Hurricane! The real body is… right above me! Primary Lotus! Is this a clone, too? Got you! Here I go, one more time! Another Shadow Clone? Nope…! Stop it, Lee. S-Sakura? – Be nice, now!\N– Don’t be too hard on me. – Please! 					– Don’t be mean! So many Sakura…\NGuy Sensei! I’m moved! I’ve never known such happiness\Nbefore in my life! – Cha! 					– Cha! Wha…?! We did it! I guess I forgot…\Nthat this is a fight with a challenger. Just as one might expect…\NBut I won’t fall for the same trick again! Even though they may look like Sakura,\Nthey’re really just phony Transformation! How can you say that, Lee? Hurry back, Sensei! For brats,\Nthey fight such a high-level fight… – Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs…\N– How about this?! I wonder if the rumors that – they lost its vigor were just lies?\N– In that case… – I guess I need to\N– Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu. investigate this further… This disguise is problematic… I get a feeling\NI will be embroiled in trouble again. Let’s go with this.\NWell then, shall I be taking my leave? Hold it right there! The real thing! I see that you are Rock Lee,\Nmaster of this Dojo. Oh no.\NI guess I’ll have to play along with him… Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee,\Nmaster of this dojo… I am a Dojo challenger! Rock Lee, I shall defeat you\Nand claim your marquee! Here I come! You fight a pretty good fight. You, too… H-Help! B-Bushy Brow?! Dynamic Entry! A-Another Dojo challenger?! Intense Brow Sensei!\NWhat took you so long?! N-Naruto…what's the meaning of this? If you can’t dodge\Neven this much of an attack, you are not worth all the talk! Your training is inadequate! N-No… This is… I mean… It’s about Million years too early for you\Nto be building your own Dojo! I must straighten that spoiled attitude\Nof yours with my own fist! Forgive me Lee…\Nlt’s my whip of love! So, the true identity of the challenger\Nwas you, Guy Sensei! What? You’re Lee?\NThen, who was I punching? Who’s that guy? Good grief… Come in! 					Oh, it’s you, Guy… And you’re with Naruto and Lee. That’s perfect.\NI was just about to call you all. Has something happened?

I’ve got a tough job waiting\Nfor me now, so… Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot! Dang it. I can’t catch him at all. I told you I’m not\Nsuch a fool, didn’t I? I already know…\Nwhich one is the real one. Oh. That is the body\Nthat has least attacks due to its fear of having\NChakra Points attacked. The more you attack, the more that one body\Nbecomes clearly evident. You’re the real one. Naruto… This is as far as it goes. I said it was pointless. Don’t let him beat you, Naruto. I’ve been telling you not\Nto frivolously assume things. What? It can’t be. All right! Go, Naruto! Naruto…! He foiled my idea and purposely\Nand drew one of his clones back? I’ve been striking from the beginning,\Nprepared for an honorable death! Believe it! I did it. That’s… W-What was that? Did you think you’d won? Why? Naruto’s punch should’ve hit. That… Rotation... That’s Neji’s defense. You punk.\NDon’t make a fool of me. The largest range of vision of\NNeji’s Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees. And he detects all of his opponent’s\Nattacks with the Byakugan. His defense technique,\Nthe 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation, will begin from here. The moment he’s attacked,\Nhe discharges a large amount of Chakra from the Chakra holes in the body,\Nblocks the enemy’s attack with that Chakra, moves his own body in a circular motion,\Ndodges and repels. Essentially, it’s difficult to control\Nthe Chakra discharged from Chakra holes… To the extent that even Jonin utilize\Nthe discharge from a part of the body, like the hands and feet,\Nin techniques. But Neji who has mastered\NGentle Fist discharges Chakra from his entire body and\Nshuts out physical attacks just with that discharge power. In other words, that’s one more absolute defense that has more power\Nthan that Gaara’s Sand Shield. T-That’s father’s… The Rotation is a secret Art passed down\Nfrom generation to generation only to the Hyuga head family,\Nin other words the Hyuga clan. He created that on his own…? He’s quite the guy…\NTo think he’d come this far. It’s much too soon to be surprised.\NNeji’s true power is still to come. Dang it. This is the end. You’re within the area of my 8 Trigrams. Gentle Fist Art. 8 Trigrams 64 Palms. It can’t be. That pose. 8 Tetragrams… …2 Palms! 4 Palms. 8 Palms. 16 Palms. 32 Palms. 64 Palms! The branch family exceeds\Nthe head family? It’s over. Truly a terrifying talent. To think the power of the\NHyuga Kekkei Genkai would be passed on so strongly\Nto a child of the branch family who would never be able\Nto be an heir. Hizashi… You should have\Nsucceeded the Hyuga family. I pressed the 64 Chakra Points\Nall over your body… You can’t even stand. D-Dang it. Are you frustrated? Kneeling down before power\Nthat can’t be changed and knowing your powerlessness. Your dreams will come true\Nif you just work hard. That’s just an illusion. Hey, Hinata. Are you okay? Oh, man. I knew it. Naruto. Bushy brow… Hinata. D-Dang it. Oh. Naruto. He… No way. I told you, didn’t I…? I don’t know when to give up. No way. Hey, you’re bleeding. What’s wrong? You’ve still got damage\Nfrom the match. Hinata… Hang in there. I’ll take a look at her. Who’re you? I’m not suspicious or anything. Stop already… It’ll be the same even if\Nyou fight more than this. I don’t have a grudge particularly\Nagainst you. S-Shut up… Even if you say so,\NI have something against you. What are you talking about? Why…? Here you’re this strong… Why did you, with a look like\Nyou’ve seen through it all, go after Hinata mentally\Nwho was trying so hard? It has nothing to do with you. Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling\Nher a failure as you please. Head family, branch family… I don’t know what happened to you. But I won’t forgive the jerk who’d\Ncall another person a failure. Hey, you. It’s okay. I’m a doctor. Okay… Fine. If you insist, I’ll tell you about\Nthe Hyuga’s destiny of hatred. In the Hyuga head family,\Nthere’s a secret Ninjutsu that’s been passed on\Nfrom generation to generation. That is the Curse Mark Arts. Curse Mark Arts? The Curse Mark represents\Na bird in a cage… and it’s a mark of those who are\Nbound to a destiny they can’t escape. W-What’s… ...t-that mark? One day when I was four years old, this accursed mark was inscribed\Non my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts. A large ceremony was held in\Nthe Village Hidden in Leaves on that day. It was also the day when the\Nhead Ninja of the Land of Lightning, the land that the Leaf had\Nfought with for many years, came for the conclusion\Nof the allied treaty. However, there was one clan… who didn’t attend the ceremony\Nthat was attended by everybody else,\Nfrom Leaf Jonin to Genin. It was the Hyuga clan… And it’s because that day\Nwas the day of hope when the head family heir\Nwas to turn three. Miss Hinata’s third birthday! My father, Hizashi Hyuga, and Miss Hinata’s father who’s over there,\NLord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers. However, Miss Hinata’s father,\NLord Hiashi, is the eldest son of the head family\Nborn into this world first. And my father who was the second son\Nis a member of the branch family. So Miss Hinata is already three… Congratulations. Thank you. She’s a cute girl, isn’t she, father? What’s wrong, father? Oh, it’s nothing. Then… I’ll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi. Yes. When the head family heir grew\Nand became three years old, I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me\Nand I became the bird in the cage. And became the Hyuga branch family. Why’s it necessary to do\Nsomething like that? Why separate into a head family\Nand a branch family? What does that weird mark mean? This mark on my forehead\Nisn’t just a decoration. The pull of your legs is weak. Yes. Listen, Neji. You will live to protect Miss Hinata\Nof the head family as well as the Hyuga power. Yes, father. Murderous Intent. My head. Father. What’s wrong, father? Go home.\NI’ll forgive the fool today only. You’re not to forget your destiny. This Curse Mark is the absolute fear\Ncalled death so to speak… that was given to the branch family\Nby the head family. The Secret Sign that the\Nhead family members form easily destroys the cerebral nerves\Nof those in the branch family. Of course, killing is easy. And this mark only goes away\Nat time of death. Sealing away the power\Nof the Byakugan. The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses\Nthe most distinctive Kekkei Genkai. There’s no end to those who\Ntarget the secret of that distinctive power. In other words, this Curse Mark\Nkeeps the branch family alive only to protect the head family\Nand does not allow disobedience. And it’s an effective system created\Nto defend for eternity the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan. And then, that incident occurred. My father was killed by\Nthe head family. One night, Miss Hinata was\Nsnatched up by someone. At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately\Nrushed off and killed the abductor. Who do you think that person was… who was in the shadows,\Nand also wearing a mask? It was the head ninja of\Nthe Land of Lightning who had just completed\Nthe allied treaty. It was clear that he came targeting\Nthe secret of Byakugan from the start. However, the Land of Lightning\Nexploited the killing of their own Ninja due to a botched plan… and set an outrageous condition in\Nviolation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf. Naturally, things got worse and worse, and there was almost a war\Nbetween the Leaf and the Lightning. However, the Leaf who\Nwanted to avoid war made a deal with the Lightning. A deal? The Lightning demand was\Nthe body of the Hyuga head family who possesses Byakugan,\Nthe Kekkei Genkai… In other words,\Nthe body of Lord Hiashi. And the Leaf accepted the condition. What? But, father… And war was safely avoided. Thanks to my father who was killed\Nas a body double of Hiashi Hyuga, to protect the head family! Other than dying, there’s no other way\Nto escape this accursed Curse Mark. Even though they were twins\Nwith nearly equal power, their destinies were already set by\Nwho was born first and born later. And then, this match… Your destiny was decided at the point\Nwhen I became your opponent. One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks Two! He kisses and hugs everyone\Nrandomly and says “I LOVE YOU” Three!

It’s true that I can’t understand… how it feels to really\Nhave parents or brothers… However… It’s my treat today…\NEat your fill! Yippee! When I’m with Iruka Sensei,\NI imagine… – Dig in! 					– Dig in! Ninja, first of all, need to\Nwarm their inner man. Hey! Hey! Don’t get too carried away\Nand overeat! If this is…\Nwhat it feels like to have a dad. When I’m with you… Idiot, idiot, idiot… What was that, you loser?! I’m not gonna lose to you,\Nno matter what! Go ahead and say\Nwhatever you want. How about this? Better not start feeling\Ntoo comfortable. I wonder…if having a brother\Nfeels something like that. Why is it, Naruto…? Why is it that you go to\Nthis extent for me…? For me it’s a tie that\NI’ve finally been able to have! That’s why I’m gonna stop you. It’s too late, Naruto…\Nlt’s already too late. I can’t go back anymore. Come, Naruto! In that case,\NI just have to cut that tie. Cut, huh? Then why wear that headband now? I’ll acknowledge you…\NYou’re strong. And the reason for that is you’re someone who knows\Nthe pain of solitude as I do. And that pain makes people stronger. And for that very reason,\Nby cutting that tie, I will be able to obtain\Neven greater strength. I will fight you now on equal terms.\NHowever… You won't even be able to\Ninflict a scratch on my forehead. That’s something that\Nwon’t change in the least. It seems that whatever I say\Nwon’t have any effect anymore, huh? Sasuke! I’m done with talking… From here on, it’s only fighting. Come! I’m able to see… I’m now able to see\Nthis guy’s movements… which I wasn’t able to see before. I’m able to see them! Sasuke’s moving completely\Ndifferent from a few moments ago. But I couldn’t care less! In any case, I can’t afford to lose! Damn it! It must be the influence of my body\Ngetting used to the state of Curse Mark. When he moves… by the subtle movements in\Nthe way he exerts his strength… I can vividly see\Nan image of his next move. With my level of “eyes,” I don’t need to use unnecessary Chakra\Nand can instead preserve it. The Curse Mark takes\Ntoo much Chakra. If I can see this much… I can time my attacks to the images of\NNaruto’s movements as I foresee them. This is no good… He’s totally reading my movements. Damn it! Oh, there you are. There’s no mistake it’s this way, right? Right. We better hurry.\NI have a bad premonition. Sasuke! Fire Style:\NDragon Flame Jutsu! Sa-su-ke… It’s too late, Naruto. It’s too late now! Naruto! You're weak, aren’t you, kid? You better be grateful to me… and to the Fourth Hokage who contained me within\Nthe likes of you! What’s going on? What was that just now? Even if I’m able to read\NNaruto’s movements completely… his Chakra makes\Na separate move of its own. It seems like the Chakra itself is moving\Nin accordance with its own will… Even with my “eyes”\NI’m unable to read it completely. That red Chakra…\Nthat’s not an ordinary Chakra! Your target is Naruto, after all. To abduct Naruto\Nis the No.1 priority placed by our organization, Akatsuki! I see… It appears that you have\Nsome kind of special power. Now I understand! Fire Style:\NFire Ball Jutsu! That Chakra is protecting him?! Calm down. I won’t be caught as long as\NI fight from distance. Damn it… This is incredible! All I can do is dodge… Please let me get there in time. Damn it, gimme a break… If I get tainted by this power … I don’t even know what\Nwill happen to me in the end… But, it can’t be helped,\Ncan it, Naruto? It is certainly true\Nthat you were special… However… I am even more special than you. Sasuke!

Gaara vs. Kimimaro Tough defense using sand… He…isn’t a close-range combat type… Getting close would be difficult, huh. It's coming! Digital Shrapnel! There’s no waste in his movements… Sure enough,\Nhe’s a considerable Taijutsu user. Attack and defense are one… He attacks and defends\Nwith sand, huh? However, the amount of sand\Nhe can control is probably… …about the amount of sand\Ninside the gourd. Gaara of the Desert…\NA dopey nickname. You can’t do anything\Nif you don’t have sand. Going to the trouble of walking around\Ncarrying heavy sand is the very proof of that. Sand Shower… How trite… As long as I have sand,\NI can do anything. You’re the one who’s dopey… It’s easy for me to do things\Nlike create sand with dirt… I get it… With his own sand he grinds things\Nlike rocks and minerals in dirt and makes it into sand. So he was sending his own sand\Nbeneath the ground and adding new sand, huh…? Gaara of the Desert… His nickname isn’t just for display. Excellent! You did it! Not yet. Sand Burial!

N-No way… That’s quite some pressure… I would’ve been flattened\Njust like that had I not made a membrane\Nof bone just below the skin. Bones…That guy’s a monster, too. It’s a troublesome body, isn’t it? I underestimated you… But, I won’t be caught by\Nyour sand anymore. Sand Tsunami!

Make them realize the ferocity\Nof the Kaguya Clan! – Yeah! 					– Right! What’re you doing, Kimimaro?\NGet going! I don’t know what to do… You don’t need to think\Ndeeply about it. Go down to the Hidden Mist Village and kill every last person\Nyou encounter! Just act on your instincts! Are you of the Hidden Mist Village? No… I-I see… Excuse me! Haku? Oh…no.

The thing you are after is right there… Now, go. It seems to have begun… The Kaguya Clan… Fools who can only find\Ntheir own path of life by fighting… It was long ago when a simple-minded group that\Njust enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable. With a governed organization\Nas an opponent, they just become fools\Nrushing towards death if they fight only with power… Are we the only survivors…? It seems we’re surrounded… The defense was tighter\Nthan we thought. We have no choice… Now it’s come to this, take along with you\Nevery person you can! We’ll have them entertain us\Nas much as possible! What do I fight for…? What am I…? Without knowing anything,\NI just kept on fighting.

I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned Time rushes us\NThe heartbeat speeds up When I woke in the middle of a dream\NI kept searching for that same light Under the shining star-lit sky with\Ncountless constellations and shadows There was something beyond that…\NWhat were you gazing at? What were you gazing at? Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name Shizune! Is anything wrong?! What is it…? It’s a protection commission\Nfrom the Village Hidden in the Stars. Is there some kind\Nof problem with that? You’ve never heard about it, Shizune? The Village Hidden in the Stars\Nis small in terms of scale, but they are very proud and\Nhave often caused trouble… So, will you accept? I can’t simply disregard it. What…? Since you-know-what\Nis in that village. And it seems they’ll form\Na three-man team with Neji as the squad leader. But the Village Hidden in the Stars\Nis a Shinobi village, isn’t it? Then they should do\Ntheir own protecting without asking others. There are often instances\Nof a small village with friendly relations\Nseeking cooperation. In particular, that village is small and it seems there aren’t\Nthat many Shinobi. No kidding. But why’s a place\Nlike that being targeted? Actually…! It all happened 200 years ago. A star fell in the village! Those stars like in the sky,\Nnot ninja stars or something?! Right! It seems\Nthere’s a mysterious power in the star that has an effect on Chakra! That’s a superstition! In the first place, no way has\Na star ever come falling down! It’s true! It’s actually been targeted\Nseveral times until now by Shinobi of other lands. By Shinobi of other lands? Mysterious power, huh? Indeed, it does seem that someone\Nlike Orochimaru would target it… All right, I guess I’ll be participating\Nin this one too! What?! But the three-man team’s\Nalready been determined. I’ve got an ace up my sleeve… Amaguriama Sweet Shop Listen up. I’ll take the lead from here. There’s danger before\Nentering the village. Okay, got it! Hi, guys! I’ll go on ahead and be waiting! Naruto! Hold it! That idiot! Umm, what’s Naruto doing\Nin a place like this? Like I know. Lady Tsunade, there was a report that Naruto has joined up\Nwith Neji’s squad. Yes. I added him to\Nthe Village Hidden in the Stars mission. Why…?! Those four proved themselves\Nin the Katabami Gold Mine… and things will quiet down\Nin the village here, too. You’d change an already determined\Nthree-man squad just for that reason?! Lady Tsunade?! Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly\Nwith gold leaf candy from Amaguriama? Could it be that was from Naruto…?\N70.01	01:06:50:29	01:06:52:26	Tea! Hurry! Mizura! You okay?! I’m fine… I told you not to push yourself! But, I don’t want to fall behind\Neveryone’s training… What’re you doing\Nduring your training?! Mizura suddenly keeled\Nover in pain… Take him to the medical treatment room. Yes sir. I’ll go, too. Hokuto by herself is\Nenough for an escort. Sumaru, you have a mission. All right! I’m here first! Once I cross this valley,\NI’ll be in the Land of Bears. The Village Hidden in the Stars\Nis close. Wha--?! You little…! Ninja Art: Kujaku… Protection! This guy blocked Kunai knives\Nwith Chakra! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Cut! Damn it! Incredible Chakra! Wait! This guy’s an enemy…\NHe suddenly attacked! You’re Leaf Shinobi, right? Are you from\Nthe Village Hidden in the Stars? I’m Sumaru.\NI came to pick you guys up. Then why did you do such a thing…? Look at that. Huh? The border of the Land of Bears\Nis constantly filled with poison gas. It’s also serves as\Na natural fortress against invasion from other lands. So this is the danger\Nyou were talking about, huh? Isn’t that great, Naruto?\NYou owe Sumaru your life! It’s the beginning of\Na beautiful friendship between the Leaf\Nand the Hidden Star Village. Give me a break. Was it none of my concern? I could have just watched\Nand not done anything… I am Akahoshi and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage\Nof the Village Hidden in the Stars. Deputy…Hoshikage? Due to the sudden passing\Nof the Third Hoshikage one year ago, presently there is\Nno Hoshikage in this village… But, I heard the only ones who can\Nrefer to themselves as a Kage are the leaders of\Nthe Five Great Hidden Villages… That doesn’t make any difference! We are not inferior to you guys! Even if we’re small now,\Nthis village will someday rival the Hidden Villages of\Nthe Five Great Nations! At that time,\NI’ll become the true Hoshikage! Silence! Go back to the training ground. H-Hey, wait up! Oh! Naruto! Naruto! Now of all times! Don’t worry about him.\NPlease continue your story. Forgive me. As  you say, the Shinobi in our village\Nare not qualified to refer to themselves as a Kage. However, in this village,\Nthere is the star that all the Kage in the Five\NGreat Hidden Villages also envy. We will use the power\Nof the star and someday, this can become a village which can\Nclaim the Sixth Kage title. So that star is being targeted, right? Yes. Our search team\Nobtained some information. Where’d that guy go? Hey! I finally caught up.\NWas your name Omaru? Not Omaru, Sumaru. Oh, sorry, sorry. But Sumaru’s sure\Nan interesting name. It’s another name for\Nthe star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star. Everyone in this village has\Na name associated with stars. After all, this is a village\Nwhere a star fell. I see… What’re you trying to elicit from me? What? Nothing in particular. I hadn’t thanked you for earlier, so. I can tell even if you give me\Nthe runaround… The people from other lands\Nare all after the star. If you have that power, you can stand above all\Nof the Hidden Villages, so… Is your awesome Chakra\Nalso the power of the star? If they had that star, would everyone have\Nthe same Chakra as you? No! The more tremendous the power, the more hard work is required\Nto control it! I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard! I’ll become the Hoshikage! Yeah! I look forward to working\Nwith you at that time! Huh…? I’m also going to become\Nthe Hokage someday, believe it! You’re a strange guy. Really? Intruder! Protect the star! But they really are collapsed entirely\Nfrom the center towards the outside. When a star explodes in mid-air,\Nit seems they collapse like this. That’s the training area\Nwhere the star is enshrined. Hurry up and show me the star. No. People from other lands\Naren't allowed beyond this spot. But the star is over there, right? I can’t protect it\Nif I can’t get close to it! It’s not like we trust you guys. Geez, you’re such a suspicious guy! Why can’t you trust us\Nwho came here on a mission?! This is my personality, you see. It can’t be?! No way. I’ll chase him down! You go to your friends\Nin the training area. Hurry! Right. Okay. Hokuto! Sumaru… I’m sorry. We couldn’t protect the star… You little! It’s ridiculous to do something\Nlike steal in someone else’s village in broad daylight, you little thief! Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu! Now, I won’t let you getaway! Ninja Art: Kujaku… This Chakra?! Beast! Uh, oh! Move away! Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu\Ntowards that monster! It’s futile! This is my real target! I found your weak point. The main body doesn’t move\Nwhile controlling the Chakra! Let’s go! Clone Body Slam! There are more ways to\Nuse my Chakra! That one hit hard. Synthesis! Damn… Naruto! Wings! You can fly?! You let him get away. I’m sorry. But… It was my mistake for\Nleaving it to you. But as for him,\Nhe used the same Ninja Art as you. What’s the meaning of this?! Only those who perform\Nthe star training can use that Ninja Art… Then you’re saying\Nhe’s someone from this village? I don’t know… I’m the one who let him get away. I’ll get the star back, no matter what! The wind blows, Ah… The pain,\NThe memories won’t disappear What should be brought along? Assemble them into a piece.

You can't defeat me with\Nthat kind of strength. Wasn't he someone\Nspecial to you? Is there someone special\Nin your life? I want to protect someone\Nspecial to me. I want to make that\Nperson's dream a reality… That's my dream. Many people misunderstand. They pity and don't finish off\Nthe enemy they ought to finish. They let them survive. To me, that isn't compassion\Nor anything. Do you know? How it feels to\Nnot be needed by anyone? To live day to day without a dream.\NThe pain of it all. What are you saying? Zabuza has no use\Nfor a weak Shinobi. You took away\Nmy reason for existence. Why? Why do you have to\Nserve a guy like that? He gets the money from thugs\Nto do bad things! Is that No-Brow\Nthe only person special to you? A long time ago,\NI had other people special to me. They were…my parents. I was born in the Land of Water,\Nin a small village heavy with snow. My parents worked on a small farm. We were very poor, but my parents seem to\Nbe satisfied with it. I was happy then… They were loving parents. But… When I was old enough\Nto understand things, something happened. Something? What happened? My blood… Blood? Go on! Tell me what happened. My father…\NHe killed my mother. Then he tried to kill me. Huh?! After the experience of\Nthe ceaseless civil war, people with Kekkei Genkai were\Nhated and feared in the Land of Water. Kekkei Genkai? It's special powers or Jutsu\Npassed on through certain clans, from parent to child,\Nor from grandparent to grandchild. Because of their special powers, those of the clans were exploited in\Nall sorts of battles. As a result, all Kekkei Genkai\Nwere feared as harbingers of disaster\Nand death. After the war was over, they decided to hide\Ntheir special powers. If anyone knew of their secret,\Nonly death could be expected. I'm sure that boy went through\Nso much suffering as well. The greater your power,\Nthe more you were feared. My mother had the Kekkei Genkai. She kept it secret from my father. She hoped that for a while… No, she must have thought that\Nthey could have a simple life forever. Look, Mommy! Look! Isn't it fantastic? Not you, too! Why? Why him, too? That hurts, Mommy! Sorry… I'm sorry, Haku… I'm sorry! However… Father had discovered our secret. When I came to… I had killed my own father. And that moment,\Nwhat I thought of myself was that… no, that is what I had to think. And then knew that it was\Nthe most painful thing. The most…painful thing…? That I… that my existence didn't matter\Nto anyone else in the world. Same with me. You told me that... You'll be the best Ninja in the village,\Nand make everyone respect you. If someone comes along and\Naccepts you for who you are, no one could be more important\Nto you than that person. Even though he knew I was from\Na clan with Kekkei Genkai, Zabuza took me in. My power that everyone hated...\NHe wanted it, needed it. Brats like you won't be needed\Nby anyone and die like dogs. You have the same eyes\Nas I do… Brat… Do you want…\Nto be needed by someone? Are you willing\Nto give everything for me? From now on,\Nyour power belongs to me. Come with me. I was so happy… Haku, bad news. I have to leave the Land of Water\Nas of tonight. However, I'll be back in\Nthis land some day. I will rule over this land. To do that... what I need isn't consolation,\Nencouragement or empty words. What I really need is… I already know. You have nothing to fear. I am your weapon, Zabuza. Keep me by you as a mere tool\Nthat heeds your every word. You're a good boy! I apologize, Zabuza. I wasn't good enough to be\Nthe tool you were looking for. Naruto! I want you… to kill me. Ninja Art, Summoning,\NEarth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu! Whatever you do won't work! You have absolutely no idea\Nwhere I am now. However… I know exactly where you are\Nand what you're about. Kakashi… You are completely\Nin my hands now. W-What is that racket? What... Just what's going on out there? If you can't use your eyes or ears,\Nsimply use your nose. That's what happens when you're closing your eyes\Nin the midst of fog. This is the Summoning Jutsu\Nspecialized for pursuit. I deliberately shed my own blood to stop your attacks both times\Nfor this. Your weapons have a thick scent of\Nmy blood on them now. Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs. And their sense of smell\Nis without equal. You're the one who\Nwas playing into my hands. The fog has lifted already. And your future is… 					death. I've had enough of your bluffs! Don't act tough! There's nothing you can do\Nin this situation. Your death is certain. Zabuza. You were too full of yourself. You're too ambitious\Nfor your own good. You assassinated the Mizukage,\Nbut failed to pull off a coup. You left the service with\Nfew men under you, and became a Rogue Ninja. Soon after, your name reached\Nour Hidden Leaf Village. You needed to raise funds\Nto strike back. And you needed to hide from the Tracking Unit's\Npursuit and retaliation. Isn't that about the reason why you hired yourself out\Nto scum like Gato? Zabuza. Do you really believe I've managed\Nto survive with just Sharingan? Here's something I didn't copy,\Na Jutsu of my own… To enlighten you! Lightning Blade! What the…?! His hand is visibly overflowing\Nwith Chakra! You are too dangerous. Tazuna, the man you are trying\Nto assassinate is the symbol of courage in this land! The bridge he is building\Nis the hope of this land! And your ambitions will sacrifice\Ncountless lives. That isn't how a Shinobi\Nis supposed to behave. Who cares? I have always fought\Nfor my own ideals. And that will never ever change! I'll say it again. Huh? Give up. Your future is… 					death! Please kill me. What are you hesitating for? No… What you said is ridiculous! You're a weapon?\NJust a tool for him? How can you call him\Nspecial to you? Are you really okay with that? Is that wrong? Huh? Tell me, what is wrong with that? Well, uh… It's not… Zabuza counts on me,\Neven if I'm worthless. He made me feel needed. But now, I've lost my usefulness\Nthat affirmed my existence. Zabuza no longer needs me. That's why,\NI am now appealing to you. Please, make it quick W-Why did this happen? Is this what it means to\Nbe a strong Ninja? To protect someone? Are you okay with that?

That's why it must be good-bye Leaving nothing behind,\Nlet us share what is left In time, we'll realize\Nthat it was everything And sadness will touch our cheeks,\Ncreating a river of tears Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex\Nand melting away This is not good,\Nlooks like a storm is coming. What? Idate… Run Idate Run!\NNagi Island Awaits! Aoi…Rokusho! I thought you had run away. Wasn’t running away\Nyour specialty? Shut up! I’m different from you! No, you are the same kind\Nof human as I am. A betrayer who doesn’t trust others. Betraying your own brother,\Nwalking away from the village, and capable of thinking only of yourself.\NThe worst kind of man. Such a man…\Ndoesn't deserve to live! Die! Sakura, is your wound okay? Uh-huh. A wound like this is nothing. But… Those Rain Ninja…huh? Yes. Hah, they’re nothing! No, it’s not that!\Nlf they’re headed towards Idate… Oh! Idate is in danger! That’s what I’ve been saying! Hey, Naruto!\NThis is no time to be playing around. No! They’re here now. Naruto! Lucky us! We are invincible in water. Geez, what a troublesome guy. They’ve now fallen into our trap. Water Clone Jutsu! Sakura! Shadow Clone Jutsu! How stupid. What use can\NShadow Clones have in this situation? There’s no way they can defeat\Nour Water Clones in water. Even if you try to trick us, I'm hanging on to the real body\Nright here. What are they trying to do? N-No way! What a whirlpool…\NChakra is intertwined in it! Naruto…you… This is the application\Nof the first step in my training for\Nthe Rasengan! Sakura! Sakura, hang in there! Sakura! Just hang in there! Come on! Sakura! Sakura! Pull yourself together! Sakura! I-I guess…I’ve got…to…do it… S-Sasuke.… I’d like it if Sasuke is the one to do… the CPR… S-Sakura… What the hell are you doing, idiot! Sasuke? We don’t have any time to spare.\NWe need to meet up with Idate. Wait, Sasuke. Hey… Don’t leave me. It's about time… Fukusuke reaches Modoroki Shrine. There’s no chance for you\Nto win now. You can’t even run\Nor stand up now. When that pain spreads\Nthroughout your whole body, you’ll reach a different finish line. The finish line of death. What are you thinking of doing\Nwith that dirty knife? Don’t touch it! Looks like you still don’t understand\Nyour situation. All you have to do is run away. You have no right to even\Nthe slightest bit of integrity. Boss… I'm sorry… Boss… I couldn't keep… the promise I made with you. Idate! You bastard! Darn, what a downpour. Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?! Looks like it was too hard\Na task for them. Even if they were\Nthe same Genin as you, seems like the Hidden Leaf ones\Nare better. This is terrible… But can Genin-level Ninja\Nfight against me? Shut up! Above! Humph… So that's your level, after all. I'll use the same method\NI used on Idate, and send you to hell. No need to waste my Chakra. Sakura! Th-These darned things… Those are poisoned needles specially\Nmade by the Hidden Rain Village. They will send you to hell\Nin a few minutes, no matter how strong you are. Don’t you look down on us! Bastard--! Looks like Fukusuke has reached\NModoroki Shrine. Die gasping. It’s a death\Nthat fits you Genin brats well. Is Wagarashi winning this one too? Isn’t there a God or Buddha\Nin this world? I miss the old times when\NJirocho was in charge. Terrible, terrible, I’m drenched. You are amazing, Fukusuke. Keep on running to the goal,\Nand make our Boss Wagarashi happy. Watch it, you scum. Who do you think you are talking to? What? My victory is already assured.\NLet me relax for a while. Bastard, think you're so hot?! Cut it out… Brother… What if something goes wrong\Nduring the race? Who knows what our boss\Nwill do to us. All right. Just wait and see. Darn, that bastard! Naruto, Sasuke… Take this. Sakura… What's that? Before leaving the Leaf Village, Lady Tsunade handed this to me. Take this with you.\NI am sure it will come in handy. Old Lady Tsunade? I think he’ll recover\Nconsciousness now. Sasuke and Naruto,\Nyou take this, too. O-Okay. Also, we’ll be too cold here,\Nso we need to move somewhere else. Brother! Look! I’ve finally become\Na Ninja, too! I see… I’ve got to become the best\Nin everything! I’ll train hard,\Nand complete lots of missions. And I’ll become a Chunin super fast. Then after that, a Jonin. I’m going to be like you, Brother! I’m Idate, the Swift Runner\Nmaking headway in life. Brother? Listen Idate… In the world of Shinobi, there is something more important\Nthan success or power. Something more important? Until you understand that,\Nit’s too early for you to talk that way. Oh! He’s conscious now. Are you okay? What happened to Aoi?! He disappeared… So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi? Idate, do you know him? He… was a teacher when\NI was in the Leaf Village. You…are from the Leaf Village? Aoi…betrayed the Leaf Village and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain. What the hell do you mean? Not yet. You have to rest a little more. How is your hand there? That hand… You kept it clenched all this time. Darn! I’d come all this way,\Nand yet I…! It’s too early to give up! And you tell us that you were once\Na Shinobi of the Leaf?! I forgot all about the Leaf… the moment\NI walked away from the village. You walked away from the village? I was depressed after failing\Nthe first test of the Chunin Exam. That was close, Idate… Don’t take it so hard. There are ways to become\Na Chunin other than the Chunin Exam. Really?! Yes, really. Just do as I tell you. Okay! Aoi Sensei… Idate… Aoi Sensei,\NI’d brought them as you told me to. All right. These are indeed the Scroll of Sealing\Nand the legendary blade, the Blade of the Thunder God, believed to\Nhave been used by the Second Hokage. Well done, Idate. Now I can become a Chunin, right? Sure you can… in the Village Hidden in the Rain. You are leaving\Nthe Leaf together with me, taking these as gifts to them. But… Of course. There's no way you can get away with\Nstealing the village’s treasures. You tricked me! To survive in this world,\Nyou must not believe in others… Remember that. Well, what are you going to do, Idate? Either way, you are already\Na Rogue Ninja. You’ll be chained in jail for life,\Nif you are lucky. You’ll be chained in jail for life,\Nif you are lucky. Ever since then,\NI haven’t returned to the village. I am an irresponsible man\Nwho can’t do a single thing right. But Boss Jirocho believed in me. Even though I'd never\Nbeen of any use to him. Boss Jirocho had faith in me! And yet, I…! He’s… He’s…like the old me… No one will ever accept you!\NDie Naruto! Duck down, Naruto! I’m…a worthless guy… W-Why? Because we are the same. He’s like me of the old days. I go around and around,\Nand get nowhere… I can’t do anything right. Aoi is right. I have…no right to live-- You idiot! There’s a person\Nwho still trusts you, right? I know, Naruto. You felt alone…\Nand you were suffering! One is enough! The race isn’t over yet! You never know how things will turn out\Nunless you try until the very end. But… Stand up now! Naruto, it’s not possible!\Nldate’s body is still… If he can’t run,\Nthen I’ll carry him on my back and run! The opponent must already be\Nin Modoroki Shrine… Don’t give up! Hey… Naruto… Sasuke… Let’s leave it to Naruto here. Jirocho is waiting for you, right? Pull yourself together! Boss, don’t you think\Nhe actually ran away? He’ll come. I believe in Idate! If you run away now,\Nyou’ll be a loser for your entire life! For the people who believe\Nin you and wait for you… It’s the fastest boat around here. I'm grateful. No problem. Edged tools aren’t\Nfor hurting people… Show them what you’ve got! Naruto! Please take me there! All right. Leave it to me!

We now start the second test\Nof the Chunin Exam! Look for the brats! Those three, right? All right! Let’s go! Okay! First we search for that thing.\NCan you do it, Hinata? Yes. Slow down, Lee! We just started. I know. But… I can’t stay still! Who knows what kind of\Npowerful foe is waiting for us?! As you already understand,\Nwe have only one target! It sounds like they’ve already started. Huh? That was someone’s\Nscream just now, right? I-I’m kinda getting nervous. I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it! I-I have to pee. Y-You… Fool! What are you doing in front of a lady! Go to the grass! Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest Oh…! Ohhh...! Aaah… that was a lot! Feels much better! C’mon Naruto! I told you not to say\Nthings like that in front of a lady--! What?! S-Sasuke… no matter what,\Nyou don’t have to go that far. W-What was that for? Where’s the real Naruto?! Huh? I don't know what the heck\Nyou’re talking about! What happened to the scratch\Nyou got earlier from the Proctor?! And…your Shuriken holster\Nis on your left leg. That guy’s right-handed. You’re worse at transformation\Nthan Naruto, you phony! Unlucky me! In that case... Which one of you got  the scroll?! Since things have come to this,\NI’ll resort to force! Fire Style:\NPhoenix Flower Jutsu! Heeeey! Sasuke! You’ve got to be kidding, loser. All right! I caught you off guard! Lucky! Paper Bomb…! This is lucky! I’ll kill you if you move!\NCalmly hand over the scroll! Sasuke! I won’t let you get away! Y-You’re always late Naruto! Absorption with my Chakra. Sasuke… Don’t just stand there, Sakura! No guarantee this guy's alone! Got it?! If you let your guard down\Nyou’ll really get killed… It’s unlucky! I came on my own\Nto conceal my presence, but that became my enemy… He got away, huh…? If there’s an instance that\Nwe become separated, don’t trust him if he looks\Nlike your teammate. Just like now there’s a possibility that an enemy will transform\Nto get close to us! – Yeah. 					– So what do we do? We’ll decide on a password. Password? Listen, if the password is incorrect,\Nno matter what he looks like… presume he is an enemy! I’ll only say it once, so listen closely. You ask,\N Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.” And the answer is this: “The chance to sneak up when a large\Nnumber of enemies are making a scene. “The quiet place has no secret hideout. “It is important for a Shinobi\Nto know the right time. “The time when an enemy is tired\Nand drops his guard.” That’s it. Okay! Could you say it again? Huh?! I told you I’d only say it once. Could it be that you couldn’t memorize it? – You fool! 					– Huh?! I got it right away! I-I memorized it perfectly! I thought just in case,\NI’d listen one more time… I’ll carry the scroll! Hey, wait Sasuke. Ouch! What is it? A new enemy?! You guys go play around … I’ll go alone… Sakura! Sasuke! Don’t come closer! First the password… Ninja song, “Ninja Chance”! Ah! Umm… The chance to sneak up where a large\Nnumber of enemies are making a scene. The quiet place has no secret hideout. It is important for a Shinobi\Nto know the right time. The time when an enemy is tired\Nand drops his guard. Good. Owwww! Hey everyone, are you okay? Naruto, wait! The password… I know… The chance to sneak up where a large\Nnumber of enemies are making a scene. The quiet place has no\Nsecret hideout. It is important for a Shinobi\Nto know the right time. The time when an enemy\Nis tired and drops his guard. – What?! 					– Huh?! What are you doing?! This time it’s someone who\Ncan dodge my attack, huh? What are you saying, Sasuke? Naruto just said\Nthe password properly. He was able to say it,\N that’s the problem! – Huh?! 					– Wha--? Do you really think that guy can\Nremember a password that long? Oh! If we asked the normal Naruto\Nwhat the password is, what do you think he’d say? “Sorry. I’ve forgotten it.” Besides, his movements when\Nhe avoided my attack… It was clearly different\Nfrom Naruto’s! Show your true self already,\Nfake one! That’s how it is, huh… But if you knew he would forget it, why didn’t you make\Nthe password shorter? I knew that you were\Nunderground eavesdropping on\Nour conversation. So I chose that password on purpose. Oh really. So you’re not tired\Nor letting your guard down. This will be more fun than I thought. This person’s…too creepy! And where’s Naruto? Huh? Owww! And heave! Huh? Where are Sakura\Nand that Sasuke? H-Huge! This is the first time I’ve seen…\Na snake this huge! Behind?! T-Tail! You want our Earth Scroll,\Ndon’t you? ‘Cause you have the Heaven Scroll. Well, let’s begin… the battle for the Scrolls. Life or Death! Genjutsu?! No, that's not it. This is simply\Na thirst for blood. What’s going on? Just looking at her eyes\Nmade me think of death. Who is this…woman?! Sa…kura…? It’s no good. We have no choice but to flee here. Unless we do, the only thing\Nwaiting for us is… Death! Let me out! Hey! Spit... me... out! Darn!\Nlt’s not going to work. Something else... Oh! The rice ball I took for lunch! Huh?! It’s dissolving! I’ll be digested just like\Nthat rice ball eventually… N-No! Let me out! Let me... out! Can’t move already...? She’s going to kill me! Move…move…move…! Move! Move! Move! Move! Even if it’s just a little…\NMove! What do you intend to do... with that? I can’t move! Don’t worry.\NI’ll end this in a second. You won’t even have\Nthe time to feel pain. I wanted you to entertain me more. It’s too bad. Am… I going to die here? Iruka Sensei Old Man Hokage… Konohamaru... Kakashi Sensei. Sakura. Sasuke. A lot happened between him and me. Even though we always squabbled, we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei\Nin that encounter with Zabuza. During our Chakra training in forest, we competed each other and\Npracticed climbing up trees. That’s it! I haven’t… settled things with him yet! – More rice! 					– More rice! If this creature doesn’t want to\Nspit me out … I’ll make it to do so at any cost! I see. Sasuke! He wounded himself\Nat the last moment… Move. Move. Move. 					Move...! Move! He wiped out the fear with pain. As expected,\Nhe’s not the average prey. Shadow Clone Jutsu! I...am a Shinobi who\Nwill become Hokage! I won’t put up with being\Nsnake dung in this place! Sasuke. Are you okay? If we don’t flee in a hurry,\Nwe’ll be discovered here, too. How do we flee…? How should we escape…? I’ve never seen Sasuke… so worked up. Sasuke, a snake! Shoot! I was too shaken up\Nto notice the snake! Don’t come near me! Don’t lower your guard,\Nnot even for a moment… A prey must always stay tense\Nand try to flee desperately... before a predator. Ahh... Huh?! Sorry Sasuke.. Naruto! The password… I forgot it! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now.

Perhaps there were multiple people\Ndisguised as the Cursed Warrior, not just one alone. If there was a person\Ninside disguised, then how do you explain\Nthe Warrior flying?! As long as our mission has\Nbeen ordered complete, there’s no reason to continue\Nthe mission in this land now. Besides, Komei confessed\Nto the crime, right? But, it’s suspicious! I can’t go along with it\Nif I don’t get the whole story! This land has\Nits own circumstances. Getting too involved\Nwill cause trouble. Humph! Then I’ll just have to do it\Nmy way. Hold it. I’m the leader of this team. So what?! You look into the movements\Nof the Cursed Warrior once more. Tenten and I will reinvestigate\Nthis incident from a different angle. What? But the mission’s over… You have a point\Nwith what you said. Everything is moving along\Ntoo swimmingly. All right! Leave it to me. Huh? Where are you going, Naruto? Isn’t it obvious?\NTo investigate the Cursed Warrior! What? Oh, Chishima. Um, Naruto just now… It’s nothing, it’s nothing. Did you have business\Nwith us? Oh, yes. You have all been so helpful\Nto me the whole time… I feel so bad about\Nthat low payment… Additional money? We couldn’t… No, it’s the specialty of\Nthe Land of Birds, chicken wing buns filled\Nwith bean jam. Yakitori Tsurucho Thanks! Sure enough,\Nthis area’s fishy, believe it. It’s kind of time-consuming\Nsearching alone… Summoning Jutsu! Ahh, long time no see.\NAre you giving me a snack? Why is it you guys?! Dad’s busy with stuff, so. No, I can’t have Boss Gama\Nappearing, either… Well, I guess it can’t be helped. You guys have a better sense\Nof smell than humans, right? You’re calling us puppies?! Geez! Toad authority\Nhas sure hit rock bottom! Gamatatsu, we’re leaving! Gamatatsu? Hey, Gamatatsu! A frog that pounces on\Na willow leaf? What’re you doing, you idiot?! Big Brother Gamakichi… I wonder what…this is? Whoa, it’s dark.\Nlt’s night. Good night. Good morning. What’s this? It’s a kite painted black. A kite? Look up there! That’s a totally huge kite,\Nbelieve it. I wonder if there was\Na big kite-flying festival or something. It’s rather plain for\Na festival kite… What?! What does that mean? Oh no! Hey! Where are you going?! I’m back. I get it… If one were to fly that\Nin the cover of a dark night… A Cursed Warrior hanging\Nonto the black kite would look like he was flying… With this, the mystery of\Nthe flying warrior is solved, believe it! Next… Someone was here\Non that night… What is it? The Cursed Warrior came out\Nfrom here. It just looks like an old temple\Nthat isn’t used much at all. You’re right. Let’s go, Gamatatsu! But Big Brother Gamakichi,\Nit’s nice and cool here. What’re you talking about?!\Nln such a hot and humid temple… Indeed, that’s a nice damp wind. See? Isn’t it comfortable? Draft from down below here…? What’s this? Wow! I wonder if\Na giant worm made this. Or a mole? All right, let’s check it out. I wonder how we should greet\Na mole if we were to meet one. Like I care! So Naruto is still investigating\Nthe Cursed Warrior, huh? I should probably inform Lord Moso. There was some trouble caused, but we have at last found\Na safe refuge. After him! Big Brother, where are we? Huh?! This place is… This is the residence of\Nthe feudal lord, isn’t it? Really? Residence of\Nthe feudal lord? No wonder\Nit’s an impressive building. It was connected to this place? What was that sound? Oh! What a nice view. Hey! What're  you doing?! Shh! Keep quiet!\NWe’ll be discovered. Big Brother Gamakichi! Uh, oh! You blockhead! Uh, umm…\NGood work with your duties! As for me,\NI’m not anyone suspicious! I was asked by\Nthe Superintendent Moso and I’m investigating the incident… It’ll make sense if\NI tell you about it! Oww! Lord Sagi! We have captured\Na suspicious man. What shall we do with him? What…? Oh! Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey!\NWe met at the lake, didn’t we? Explain to them about me! I know no such person. What?! He’s not worth sending\Nto the magistrate’s office. Lock him in the dungeon. Yes, my lord! Hey, that’s harsh! Come on, Sagi! Hey! Wait a minute!\NCome on, hey! Come on.\NThis is a misunderstanding! I was just going after\Nthe Cursed Warrior! Umm, everything will make sense\Nif you just ask Mr. Moso. You okay? Yo! I can’t be fighting the soldiers\Nof my employer’s land. Geez. You had to go and\Nget caught in that trap! Well, it’s cool. I can get out\Nof a place like this right away if I just use both my hands. Hey, untie this. Right. Just a second. Wha--?! Th-The Cursed Warrior…?! Damn it! If I could just use both hands,\Nthis guy would be…! Big Brother,\Nare we going to let things be? If things go wrong,\Nwe’d be sliced in two. I wouldn’t want that. Just a little more… Just a little more…! Sagi?! What’s going on here? You’re the other Cursed Warrior? But, why? They say people become disembodied\Nspirits and avenge themselves… But that’s a lie! This watch has been handed down\Nfrom generation to generation in the feudal lord family. It was supposed to be passed\Nfrom father to son… But now along with that death,\Nthe watch has stopped ticking away. It must have been very sad… I am shamelessly living on\Nonly for the sake of revenge! I can go to hell if\NI can just complete my revenge! That’s no good! There is no way you could understand how someone who has had everything\Ntaken away from them feels! Like I know about stuff like that! But I, at least, know that living for\Nthe sake of revenge is wrong! You’re a feudal lord, aren’t you? Is revenge the job\Nof a feudal lord? You know that’s not it. The true culprit Komei\Nhas been arrested. You should just leave\Nthe rest to Moso. Okay? It is no concern of yours… I must not let you live now that you have\Nlearned everything! As the thief who snuck into\Nthe residence of the feudal lord… your fate is a death sentence! No way…! This is creepy… This is the tomb of the successive\Ngenerations of feudal lords, right? Yeah. That’s the tomb of the Lord Owashi… Byakugan! What’s this? What is it, Neji?\NWhat are you seeing?! There’s something poisonous\Nin Owashi’s body. Was he assassinated…?! We’re surrounded. An announcement to\Nthe Ninja from the Leaf Village. A message has just\Nnow been delivered from the residence of\Nthe feudal lord! Your comrade has been arrested\Nfor infiltrating… the residence of the feudal lord… and his death sentence\Nhas been determined! Leave the Land of Birds at once! If you don’t, you will be executed here\Nfor the same crime. It doesn’t matter!\NDraw your bows! Neji, what should we do? Let’s go to the residence\Nof the feudal lord. We’re going to save Naruto! You’re… Kakashi Sensei!\NNaruto’s in trouble! We have to go to the residence\Nof the feudal lord immediately and save him… We can’t do that. Your mission is over. But! Don’t do anything other\Nthan the mission. So many things happen\Non this endless road, huh? Although you’re strong-willed,\Nyour voice wavered on the phone today What dreams did you chase to get here?

I told you. Our mission in\Nthe Land of Birds is finished now. But then, what’ll happen\Nto Naruto? We can’t interfere with\Nthis land’s internal affairs. No way… Sorry.

Gantetsu took care of all of us kids\Nwho had become orphans… Gantetsu. Is it the Ninja Dropouts again? I’m sorry. Where am I? So you woke up. Mother…? Father…? Where’s Mother? You poor thing…\NBut we’re all in the same boat. You’re not alone…\NWe’re here for you… We’re your new family. I’m leaving the Ninja Dropouts! I can’t stand this any longer. I can’t commit robberies with\Nthose guys anymore. But if you don’t,\Nthey’ll kill you, Gantetsu. I’ll steal their money. Huh? And I’ll get myself captured\Nby the police. Come on… If I do that, they’ll show up in front of\Nthe prison to try to get me back. That’s the only way\Nthey can be captured. Are you saying you’re gonna\Nbe a decoy…? It's so that there won’t be\Nany more victims. This is my only choice. Gantetsu really did steal their money\Nand was captured by the police. We came to this forest because we were worried\Nabout Gantetsu’s safety. We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts\Nwould get caught. However… So Gantetsu reformed himself and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right? We have to do something about\Nthe real evil, the Ninja Dropouts! I don’t really care about\Nthe Ninja Dropouts right now. What’s important is that\Nwe rescue Gantetsu. I’m guessing that Gantetsu\Nis with Naruto. Don’t worry because he won’t have\Nbeen captured by the Ninja Dropouts. Okay, let’s believe that. Damn… If things continue like this,\Nwe’ll turn into dried fish. Huh? H-Hey… It loosens up a little\Nwhen sweat soaks into it. What? Are you serious? Oh, you’re right. Yeah, I know… What?! I’m used to its venom.\Nlt’s nothing. I find it hard to believe\Nthat Gantetsu’s that evil a guy. I’m gonna meet up with Gantetsu\None more time and find out for myself,\Nno matter what it takes… That’s right…\NI need to see Gantetsu again, too. I will then avenge the deaths\Nof my family…and of my little brother. We did it! That was a narrow escape! All right… Let’s hurry up and\Nrescue Gantetsu! Yeah… I will find him no matter what\Nand I'll cut him down! Huh? –Gantetsu. 					–Huh? That’s definitely Gantetsu. Those guys are… I-Idiot… –Gantetsu! 					–Gantetsu! Gantetsu! That’s as far as you’ll go, kid. That guy is… Don’t tell me he’s a Ninja Dropout?! Good answer. I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout. Give Gantetsu back! I’m not forgiving you for this! Hey, hey… Who are these little brats? Perhaps they’re inexperienced\Nin the ways of the world, but… to tell me to give Gantetsu back… Give us back what we want.\NThat’s our line, right? Who the heck are you guys? You Ninja Dropout jerks… We are avenging our families’ deaths! What?! You brats just stay quiet. Damn it! Stop! Monju! Let that kid go! It looks like you don’t quite comprehend\Nthe position you’re in right now, huh?! And moreover, what do they mean\Nby avenge, huh, Gantetsu?! Stop! Ninja Art: Mesh Cage! It’s my turn! It doesn’t even budge. It’s useless… You won’t be able to\Ntear through this net. Come on, Gantetsu, answer me. I refuse. Huh… I see. Then how about this? Akio! Stop it! I get it.\NI’ll talk, so please stop! You should have done that\Nfrom the start. These children are the children\Nfrom the homes that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked. I rescued them and gave them shelter. What? You betrayed us? I see… You jerk… You took our treasures and\Ngave them to these guys. They belonged to their families\Nin the first place.

But no matter how dedicated\Nour efforts are… to think there are dimensions\Nthat cannot be transgressed… That’s the direction of\Nthe Feudal Lord’s palace… Hurry up!

Sagi totally squashed us just now\Nand went off somewhere! Gimme a break…\Nthat guy’s some kind of jerk! Please don’t blame him for\Nthe things he has done. But…! He is himself,\Nbut not himself right now. Huh? What do you mean? He is obsessed with avenging his father and\Nyounger sister’s deaths.

Are you sure it's our target Tora? It's the target, no mistake. Alright, the mission to capture\Nlost pet ""Tora"" is complete! Isn't there a mission\Nwith a greater sense of urgency?!

The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo\N(Feudal Lord)\N		Madame Shijimi and Tora (the Cat) Serves him right, that stupid cat! No wonder he ran away… …Now, then! The next mission for\NKakashi's seventh squad is… An errand to the neighboring town…\Nto baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy… Helping with digging\Nfor potatoes, eh… Nooooo! No! No, thank you! As for me, I want to do like\Na more exciting mission! Give us something else! He's got a point… Man… He's a pain! I thought it was about time\Nfor him to get fretful… You fool!\NYou're still bottom rookie! At the start, everyone moves up\Nthe ladder by gaining experience\Nfrom simple missions! B-But! It's been nothing\Nbut blah missions so far! Knock it off! Naruto! It's necessary to explain to you\Nwhat a mission is… Listen to me! Requests pour into the village\Nevery day. They range from babysitting\Nto assassinations… A wide spectrum of requests are\Nrecorded on the request list… They are separated into A, B, C,\Nand D ranks in order of difficulty. In the village,\Neveryone below me is divided up by ability in the order of\NJonin, Chunin, and Genin. We at the highest level distribute\Nthe requests as missions to Ninjas who have abilities\Nthat suit said mission. And, if the mission is successful,\Nthe fee comes in from the client. Nevertheless, you guys\Nhave just become Genin… rank D is about\Nthe best you can do… Hm?! Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone\Nbroth noodles, so today will be miso broth… Listen! I-I'm sorry. Maaaan!\NYou always lecture me, old man! But I'm not that little prankster\Nthat you think I am! Humph! Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later… This kid who could only\Nexpress himself with pranks… Okay, fine! Huh…?! If you insist… I'll have you do a Rank C mission… You'll be bodyguards for someone. Really?! Ah-ha! Who? Who? A feudal lord?! Or, a princess?! Don't get so hasty. I'll introduce you now! Could you please come in…? Huh…?! What's this? It's just a bunch\Nof darned squirts! Huh…? Particularly you, the smallest one\Nwith the idiot face. Are you really a Ninja? Who's the smallest one with\Nthe idiot face he's talking about…? What?! I'll kill him!! What good will it do to\Nkill the old man you're supposed to be\Nguarding, you moron?! I'm Tazuna,\Nveteran bridge builder. You'll be risking life and limb\Nin guarding me to the max until I return to my land and\Ncomplete my bridge! All right! We're off!! What're you so excited about?! You see, I've never left\Nthe village before! Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?! I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him.\NThere's no need to worry. ...okay with this squirt?! Anyone but this old dude, man… He's really the worst client! I'll tell him a thing or two… Hey, old man! Don't be mocking Ninjas\Nso much! I'm awesome, you see! I'm a super-elite Ninja who\Nwill be called Hokage one day! My name's Naruto Uzumaki. Remember it well!! The Hokage's the super top-dog\NNinja in the village, right? You sure as heck don't seem like\Nyou could become the Hokage… Aaah! Shut up! I'm prepared to do whatever\Nit takes to become the Hokage! You'll have no choice\Nbut to acknowledge me then!! I'll never acknowledge you, squirt… Even if you become the Hokage! What?! I'll kill you! I told you to stop it, you moron! No! At least let me have\None shot, just one… Say…Mr.Tazuna…? What is it? Your country is\N ""The Land of the Waves,""  right? What of it? Say, Kakashi Sensei… Are there Ninjas in that land, too? No, there aren't Ninjas in\Nthe Land of the Waves… But in other nations, while cultures\Nand customs are different, hidden villages exist,\Nand there are Ninjas there. To the many nations on the continent, the existence of Shinobi Villages is\Na measure of the nation's military strength. In other words, that is how these nations maintain\Ntheir relationships with neighboring nations. Even so, the villages are not\Nunder the control of the nations. They are equal in rank. On a small island like\Nthe Land of the Waves, where it is difficult to be\Ninfluenced by other nations, there is no need\Nfor a Shinobi village. Among the respective nations\Nthat possess a Shinobi Village, the five nations of ""Fire,"" ""Water,""\N""Lightning,"" ""Wind,"" and ""Earth,"" due to their large territory and\Nimmeasurable power, are called the ""Five Great Nations."" The Village Hidden in the Leaves\Nof the Land of Fire, the Village Hidden in the Mist\Nof the Land of Water, the Village Hidden in the Clouds\Nof the Land of Lightning, the Village Hidden in the Sand\Nof the Land of Wind, the Village Hidden in the Rocks\Nof the Land of Earth. Only the leaders of\Neach of these Hidden Villages are allowed to have\Nthe name of Kage, the Shadow. The ""Hokage""\N(Fire shadow),"" ""Mizukage"" 					(Water Shadow), ""Raikage""\N(Lightning Shadow), ""Kazekage"" 					(Wind Shadow), ""Tsuchikage""\N(Earth Shadow), the so-called\NFive Kage (shadows), reign supreme over\Nthe tens of thousands of Ninjas in each nation\Nof the whole world. No kidding…\NLord Hokage is that incredible! I wonder if that blah old man\Nis really that incredible… Sounds fishy! That can't be true! No way! Hey! You guys just doubted\NLord Hokage now, didn't you…? Well…don't worry. There are no Ninja battles\Nin Rank C missions. Then, there's no worry of getting\Ninto a scrape with foreign Ninjas…! Of course, not. What?! Huh?! W-What? The first one! K-Kakashi Sensei! The second one… The second one… Ohhh…! Hm?! It doesn't come off! W…Wow!! Whoa! Ugh!! They'll come! I have to do it…\NI have to!! Get back, sir!! Yo… Kakashi Sensei…! He's alive! Humph! 					Show off… Whaa--?! Then, what was that…? So Kakashi Sensei…used Substitutions… Naruto…\NSorry I didn't help you right away… I got you hurt. I didn't think you'd be\Nincapable of moving… I was saved, somehow… Anyhow, let me just say,\Ngood job, Sasuke. You, too, Sakura. I…couldn't do anything… but Sasuke… It was his first real battle… Didn't he feel scared, at all? He saved me like it was nothing and\Nwithout getting any dirt on his clothes… Hey… Huh?! Are you hurt… scaredy cat...? Sasuke! Naruto! These guys have poison\Non their claws. You need to\Ntake out the poison quickly. What?! You have to open the wound and\Ndrain the poisoned blood. Don't move so much. The poison will spread. By the way, Mr. Tazuna… W-What is it…?! I have something\Nto talk to you about. Chunin from the\NVillage Hidden in the Mist… These guys are Ninjas known for\Ncontinuing to fight no matter what the sacrifice. How were you able\Nto detect our movements? There probably wouldn't be\N puddles of water on a clear day like today,\Nwhen it hasn't rained for days. Knowing that, why'd you leave it\Nto the kids to fight? If I felt like it,\NI could kill these guys instantly… But… 					I had to know... who the target\Nof these enemies was… Hm?! What do you mean? In other words... what I mean is I had to know\Nif it was you, or one of us Shinobi…\Nwho was being targeted. We haven't heard anything about\Nyou being targeted by Ninjas. The content of the request was\Nsupposed to just be protection from gangs,\Nthieves, and the like… This is a mission with\Na B rank or higher. The request was supposed to be for backup protection\Nuntil you finished building your bridge… If our enemies were to be Ninjas, the mission would've been\Nestimated without question as an expensive\N ""B Rank""  mission. It appears there's some kind\Nof good reason for this, but being lied to in the request\Nwon't do. This is beyond the scope\Nof our mission. This mission is too soon for us… Let's give it up! We need an anesthetic to\Nopen Naruto's wound and get out the poisoned blood… We have to return to the village\Nand take him to a doctor… Hmmm… Hm? What...?! This sure is a burden! Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,\Nshall we go back to the village…? Huh! Oh! Why am I so different?! Why's it always me…\NDarn it! Naruto! What're you doing?! I should be getting stronger… Here I'm steadily carrying\Nout missions and doing special-skill training\Nby myself every day… I'll never get into another situation\Nfrom which I'll have to be rescued. I'll never be afraid\Nor a be a coward… I won't lose to Sasuke… I'm going to swear on\Nthe pain of my left hand! I'll protect you, old man…\Nwith this Kunai knife!! The mission continues!! Naruto… It's all well and good to\Nrid yourself of the poisoned blood, but any more than that and\Nyou'll bleed to death. Things will get hairy if you don't\Nstop the bleeding quick... Seriously! Yikes! Argh! No! No! I can't die like this, I say! Show me your hand. Nooo! Help me!! Naruto! You're really self-abusive,\Naren't you! That's masochistic! The wound is… already starting to heal… Um…um… Am I okay?\NYou look awfully serious… Well…You should be okay. Is it…the power of\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox…? Did you say you failed?! I paid a lot of money to hire\Nyou guys because you said\Nyou were once hot-shot Ninjas! Stop your darned grumbling…!! Next time, I'll kill him with this…\Nhead chopper! I-It's really okay, right?! It seems that the enemy\Nhas hired good Ninjas… On top of that, a tightened guard\Non account of the Demon Brothers' failure means that it won't be easy… Just who do you think I am?! This Zabuza Momochi,\Nwho is called the demon of… the Hidden Mist!! We've finally landed ashore\Nin the Land of the Waves. The guys before were\Nall well and good, but there should be even\Nstronger guys lying in wait. Okay! I'm going to regain\Nmy honor and continue the mission. No matter what enemy comes, I'll protect the old man\Nthis time around for sure. Oh, they wasted no time. An impressive-looking guy with\Na huge Katana has come.

All four of them have been caught in\Na Genjutsu and are unconscious. Kurenai Sensei! S-Sensei… Kurenai Sensei! She’s nowhere to be found! Byakugan! What is it?!

Let’s go! – Yeah! 					– Yeah! U-zu-ma-ki! Naruto Barrage! I’ll definitely get Yakumo… Byakugan! Yakumo has been sedated to calm\Nher nerves and is asleep now. But it would be best for her to have a complete examination\Nback at the village hospital. It was a big help having\Nyou here, Sakura. You should also get\Nsome first-aid treatment, Sensei. Right… Thanks. Okay, please show me. They’ve been like this the whole time. It doesn’t look like they’ll wake up\Nfrom the Genjutsu for quite a while… Well, I guess that serves\Nour interests better. Hm? It’s…! Kurenai Sensei! Oh! Thank goodness you look okay! Y-Yes… She’s not okay! Wha--?! I gave her some first-aid treatment,\Nbut she has a deep wound. We must get back to the village quickly… Don’t worry about me. I’m more concerned about\NYakumo’s instability. Yeah, their comrades could\Nvery well return. I’m also concerned about how we haven’t seen the three people\Nwho were assigned to guard Yakumo. All right! Leave this to me and all of you\Nhead back to the village with Kurenai and Yakumo! Organize a back-up unit. Your opponents are practitioners\Nof Genjutsu. Will you be okay alone? What? This fully… …trained body! I would cram by the likes\Nof the Kurama Clan’s Genjutsu! A pun? Oh? Are you awake? Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei\Nfor sealing your Genjutsu?! That person hates me… She didn’t want to make me into\Na practitioner of Genjutsu. It’s not like that! Then…why?! I’m sure she had some kind\Nof reason! You would’ve been in trouble\Nhad Kurenai Sensei not risked her life to save you before! That was the Kurama Clan…\NPeople from the same clan as me. What? Why would people\Nfrom the same clan as you…? Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei\Nback to the village? I’m fine…\NI can at least do that myself. Kiba?! Hey, Kurenai Sensei?! Tell us the truth! Isn’t this incident and you\Nquitting our squad… somehow related? The Kurama Clan into\Nwhich Yakumo was born… was once a force in\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves as a family of Genjutsu users. However, they had been brought\Nto ruin in recent years, unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin. Then a rising star brimming with\Ntalent appeared in the clan. And that was Yakumo. My parents and relatives placed\Ntheir hopes in me, the only daughter of\Nthe head family. But I was in poor health and\Nmy official entrance into the Academy was not acknowledged. I had wanted to live up\Nto the expectations of my parents and the clan… and I got really depressed. My father saw me like that and negotiated directly with\Nthe Third Hokage for me. The Third Hokage whom\NMurakumo consulted realized the high level of\NYakumo’s latent power and decided to leave her\Nin my custody. By the order of the Third Hokage, Kurenai Sensei became\Nmy personal teacher. But… Y-Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei… She…! Why?! I don't know. Maybe since I’m a Genjutsu user too, I got jealous of the high level\Nof Yakumo’s latent powers. Jealous…?! Genjutsu practitioners with\Nhigher powers than mine are not necessary in this village. No way. You’d do that for\Na reason like that…? You understand, don’t you? A selfish person like me can’t continue\Nto go on missions with your lives entrusted to me. I can’t believe that! It’s not just her…\NI’m a hindrance to the Leaf Village. Wh-What do you mean? I just can’t believe it. Isn’t Kurenai Sensei still hiding\Nsomething from us…? I also…get that feeling. Exactly. It’s because… Kurenai Sensei’s hand shook\Nwith heartache when she talked about events\Nin the past. But the shaking stopped…\Nwhen she talked about her motive. What do you mean? That motive is a lie. The heart is not affected by\Na made-up story. Then her being jealous of Yakumo… Perhaps she’s protecting someone. Someone so important\NKurenai Sensei would protect? That would be, for example… I overheard Kurenai Sensei\Nand the Third Hokage talking. Yakumo’s powers probably\Nwill not awaken for a long while. I see. But the time will eventually come when the dam bursts and\Nher powers will pour out. That power of the Kurama Clan\Nwill eventually threaten the Village Hidden in the Leaves. At that time,\Nwe’ll have to eliminate it. Even the Third Hokage was\Ninvolved with the sealing of my powers. The Third Hokage would\Nnever order something like that! My parents died just before I started training under\NKurenai Sensei. There was a sudden fire. It seems the fire spread quickly\Nand they couldn’t be saved… But my parents were even Jonin! To think they would die\Njust in a fire. And a fire in broad daylight\Non top of that… And after that, although I was told\Nthere was no foul play… the autopsy reports were\Nclassified and sealed. No way?!\Nlt wasn’t just an ordinary fire? My parents were killed on\Norder of the Third Hokage…! No way…!\NNo way could that ever be true! The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by Even if rains of spears were to fall,\NI will run through it Because I want to find the joy\Nwithout a shape This big dream of mine that\Ncannot be translated to words, I will make it come true,\Neven if it were to deepen my wounds We stand here today because of\Nwhat we believed through, That is why I will continue running forward,\Nnever looking away Even if I’m told that\Nthere is no bright future I’ll change it right away,\Nlighting it with all my feeling The wind is probably testing our hearts In my heart, I gently grasped my hands You are probably searching for\Nthe answer to your tears Your dream is always waiting near by,\Nwith the answers in its hands The Key to the rusted heart’s door Will always be smiling right near by The story I heard from the girl. The story I heard from\NKurenai Sensei. Which one is true?\Nlt’s unlikely that they’re all lying. But I can say this. There’s no way the Third Hokage\Nwould think about eliminating the girl.

If we all do it together, we can beat Gatô and\Nhis men this time! Inari… I made up my mind not\Nto fight anymore. Even your father… The man we called a hero… He's not with us anymore. If we were to fight,\Nmany lives would be lost. I don't want lose something that's\Nspecial to me anymore. No one wants to regret again. I… I don't want to regret again, either. That's why we must fight! A man should live\Nhis life without regrets. I love Mommy and Grampa. And you too, Old Man Giichi! I love all the people here!

I'm asking you to fight with me! Old man! Please listen to me! Why… Why won't anyone open\Nthe door to me? You are strong! Naruto… Zabuza. You were too full of yourself. You're too ambitious for your own good. You assassinated the Mizukage,\Nbut failed to pull off a coup. You left the service with\Nfew men under you, and became a Rogue Ninja. Soon after, your name reached\Nour Hidden Leaf Village. You needed to raise funds\Nto strike back. And you needed to hide from the Tracking Unit's\Npursuit and retaliation. Isn't that about the reason why you hired yourself out\Nto scum like Gatô? Zabuza… Do you really believe I've managed\Nto survive with just Sharingan? Here's something I didn't copy,\Na technique of my own… to enlighten you! Lightning Blade! What the…?! His hand is…\Nvisibly overflowing with Chakra! You are too dangerous. Tazuna, the man you are trying\Nto assassinate, is the symbol of courage\Nin this land! The bridge he is building\Nis the hope of this land! And your ambitions will\Nsacrifice countless lives. That isn't how\Na Shinobi is supposed to behave. Who cares? I have always fought for\Nmy own ideals. And that will never ever change! I'll say it again. Huh? Give up. Your future is…death! Naruto… I want you to kill me. Please, make it quick. What are you hesitating for? I just don't get it! The only reason you are allowed\Nto live is because you stay strong? There must be something other\Nthan just fighting… There must be some other way for you to make\Nthe others accept you! Remember when we met at the forest?\NDo you know what I thought? That you and I are much alike. I'm sure you can relate to me. I apologize for dirtying\Nyour hands with my blood. Is that it? Is there really no other way? No. If only…we had met under\Ndifferent circumstances, we could've been friends. Please…promise you will\Ngrasp your dream. He too… Sasuke also had dreams of his own! Thank you…\NYou will become stronger. Hmm… The super thick fog\Nhas finally begun to clear. There are two over there! They are facing off each other. Huh? I can't see well… Which one is Kakashi Sensei… One moved! Huh? Forgive me, Naruto… I cannot die yet! Is this the end…? What was that? Zabuza… Did you say my future\Nwas death? You're off the mark again, Kakashi! No… You're not to go to the bridge alone! I went all over the town,\Nbut no one wants to come. I have no choice! But… Wait! 					You're just a child! I may be a child, but I already\Nknow what it means to fight. Because I'm my father's son! My dear… Wait a moment, Inari! Where did he go…? I didn't notice,\Nbut the fog is starting to lift… Huh? Is he over there? Huh?! What the heck is going on here?! Isn't that the masked boy? I didn't expect him to jump in\Nto save Zabuza… The boy…is already dead. You did great, Haku. Kakashi Sensei! He intends to slash me\Nalong with the boy?! That was really a great find I made! Even in his final moment, he gave me such\Na perfect opportunity! Haku, bad news. I have to leave\NLand of Water as of tonight. However, I'll return\Nto this land someday. I will rule over this land. To do that, what I need isn't consolation,\Nencouragement or empty words. What I really need is… I already know. You have nothing to fear. I am your weapon, Zabuza. Keep me by you as a mere tool\Nthat heeds your every word. You're a good boy! Haku died and you were\Nable to move, huh? I won't forgive you! Naruto! You just stay there and watch! This is... my battle! Naruto… Naruto!\Nlt's good to see you! Sakura… Where's Sasuke? Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke? Sakura… Kakashi! You have no time to take\Nyour eyes off me! Why don't I go with you? That way, you won't be going\Nagainst your Sensei's word. Right… Sasuke… Huh?! He's cold. This isn't Genjutsu, is it? Don't mind me. This isn't the time to\Nhold back your emotions… I-I always got perfect scores\Nat the Ninja Academy… Huh? I memorized all the\Nhundreds of Shinobi rules. All the tests were a breeze. Until one day,\Nthis question came up… State Rule ♪ 25 of\Nthe Ways of the Shinobi… As always, I simply wrote down\Nthe answer without batting an eye.

Hey, wait! What’re you guys doing?! Anbu Black Ops?! Naruto Uzumaki,\Nleave this place immediately. Huh?! As for her, what’d she do? It doesn’t concern you. Listen up. Don’t breathe a word\Nof what you saw here. Knock it off! Just a minute! Don’t get in our way! Oh! They vanished… Damn it! What’s going on?! Oh, important documents are soaked. This will have to be dried in the sun. I’ll take them outside. Thanks. ‘Morning. Oh, Kurenai Sensei. Is the Fifth Hokage in? Yes. So? Is there no change to your sentiment\Nabout pulling out of Squad 8? No. Think about it carefully. Kiba, Shino, Hinata… You’re the one who recommended\Nthose guys lacking in experience for the Chunin Exam. You don’t care about them? But I must not leave that\Nproblem unresolved. It’s my responsibility, so… That incident was no fault of yours. If the Anbu Black Ops are involved,\Nthen is she a considerably bad person? Or was she involved in some kind\Nof significant incident? What did you say?! Calm down, Kiba. Kiba, Hinata? Hey, Shino. Say that again! Very well. I said it’d be futile. How dare you say something like that…! Cut it out! Naruto. Calm down. What the hell’s wrong? We in Squad 8 were left high\Nand dry by Kurenai Sensei. Huh? What do you mean? You see, Sensei spoke to us\Ndirectly about it. My duty is completed. You will probably be provided with\Nanother Jonin in charge eventually. Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei. Sensei… It’s written in stone. Our relationship is just that of\Ncommander and subordinate. It’s just the team formation changing\Nas circumstances demand. And that was that.\NShe didn’t even give us a reason. That was that?\NAre you guys going to accept that? Hell no! That’s why I’m saying we should\Nmarch into the Hokage’s office and protest why she is removing\NKurenai Sensei from our Squad 8! Then this Shino says… I’m saying it’s futile. It’s because this might be something\Nshe herself decided on. Pig-headed jerk…! Hinata, what do you think? I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay\Nas our Jonin in charge… But… But what?! Kurenai Sensei might have some kind\Nof reason of her own… Umm… So you’re the same as Shino, huh? No… Kiba! Just stop fighting already.\NI’ll do something about this. Naruto, you’re not even on this team. What’re you going to do? Leave it to me. I won’t let Kurenai Sensei quit,\Nno matter what. I blurted out that they can leave it to me,\Nbut I don’t know. Hm? Kurenai Sensei. What’s she doing? All right, I should ask her directly. Umm, Sensei. Naruto. I heard from Kiba and the others. What? Don’t give up being in charge of Squad 8. They’re really depressed. That’s why you went to\Nthe trouble of coming? Yeah. It seems they really revere you. I don’t know what you heard\Nfrom those kids, but I can’t do that. I don’t deserve to. Deserve? Please tell them all for me.\NTell them I’m never coming back. Sensei. Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all. Since it’s come to this,\NI guess I’ll try Grandma Tsunade directly. Naruto. Sakura! What is it? Kurenai Sensei says she’s going\Nto quit Squad 8, so I’m going to try asking\NGrandma Tsunade directly. I think that’d be useless… Probably. It’ll be okay. As for me, I know the place where\Nshe keeps her alcohol hidden, so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune… What I meant was that she must have\Nsome good reason for quitting. What? What? By any chance,\Ndo you know something, Sakura? Huh? You know something, right? Tell me. No, don’t know anything. Come on, tell me! You’re a pest. Would I ever do something like eavesdrop\Non someone’s important talk? What? You eavesdropped? Yikes! You idiot. Don’t talk so loud! Yakumo? Yeah. If I remember correctly,\Nthat’s what she said. I am at fault for letting Yakumo\Nbecome like that. No, I’d say instead that she was\Nfine up until now because I put her in your custody… Shizune, how’re the\Nnursing arrangements? A three-man team consisting of two Medical Ninja and\None Anbu Black Ops member are keeping a 24-hour watch over her\Nin a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill. Even so, you can’t rest easy? No. I want to take responsibility\Nin my own way. Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning… The conditions are spot-on. What was the girl’s name again? Yakumo. Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura. Hey, Naruto.\NDon’t tell anyone I said anything! Yeah, I know. If that girl is Yakumo, then she might know something\Nabout Kurenai Sensei. Lee, you are not stepping in\Ndeep enough. Right. Kurenai Yuhi. I make this request with full confidence that you are the best practitioner\Nof Genjutsu in this village. Could you take charge of that girl? Who’s this girl? Yakumo Kurama. You know about\Nthe Kurama Clan, don’t you? Yes. At one time, they were a clan excelling\Nin Genjutsu and were a power in\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves in the same way as the Uchiha Clan. But they haven’t been blessed\Nin recent years with talent, their force has weakened and they have not been able to\Nturn out Jonin-class Shinobi. Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama… Yes… She’s the only daughter\Nof the Murakumo of the head family. She has health issues and is\Nnot enrolled in the Academy. Then you want me to take charge of her and train her to be\Na practitioner of Genjutsu? No. There’s no doubt Yakumo’s latent\NGenjutsu powers are excellent. So much so that those in the clan put their dreams of rebuilding\Nthe family on her. Was there some kind of problem? This is just between us. Yes. Yakumo’s parents, Murakumo Kurama\Nand his wife died, but… You okay? Don’t push yourself too hard. I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m just a bit out of breath. Listen to me, Yakumo. A Shinobi is not your only path. Huh? You’re a girl and you should\Nhave many other ways to live. I want to become a Ninja! I heard there’s a student named Rock Lee\Nwho can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu. I may not have much physical strength, but I could become a Ninja if I were to\Nuse that power, right? A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei. I’m not a teacher like Guy. Unfortunately, I cannot train you. All right, that’s all for today. Thank you very much. Take a bath and get a good rest. Right. Good-bye. Lee has improved again, huh? I heard.\Nlt seems you’re quitting Squad 8. I have no choice. Those who develop under me\Nend up not developing. It’s not like that. Although they’re no match for my team, the growth of the Genin in\Nyour team is striking. If that’s the case,\Nit’s not because of my help. It’s the results of their own efforts. Hey, Kurenai. What do you think it is that we can do? As you say, Lee growing to that extent\Nis due to his own efforts. All I did for him was to believe in him. We believe in our pupils even\Nat the cost of our lives. We just need to believe in them\Nwith all our power, and embrace them with all our power. It’s not a difficult thing in the least. Guy, I envy you… I couldn’t even do something that simple. Hey, Kurenai. Believe in yourself! From where and how are Kurenai Sensei and that girl from\Nthis morning connected? It would seem to be worth looking into. That must be\Nthe Satomi Hill mountain cottage. Satomi Hill Cottage The east trap? So it seems. An intruder? Yes. Kurenai. Good work on your 24-hour guard.\NI came to visit Yakumo. This late at night? Yakumo is resting inside. Could you guys step away for a bit?\NI want to talk to her alone. Yes, ma’am. Don’t be long. I’ll be done in ten minutes. Fine. Nothing but creepy paintings. Please, Sensei! – What?! 					– What?! Whoa, my heart, my heart! Huh? There’s nothing wrong. Hey, it’s you again?! To think you’d transform into Kurenai\Nwith a Transformation Jutsu. Hey, what the heck was that earlier? Shut up! For your sake,\Ndon’t be nosing around needlessly. Hey. You’re Yakumo. Right?

But… Naruto, what in the world happened\Nwith you and that girl? Aw c’mon! I told you\Na little while ago, she saved me! What happened? Sorry, my hand slipped. I see. I’ll clean this up right away. Anko. Yes? The studies here,\Nthe Hokage knows about them. I understand. So, you’re saying that this girl\Nnamed Isaribi saved you? Yeah, I owe my life to her. Even if that’s so, there’s no doubt\Nthat this girl named Isaribi was one of the people\Nwho attacked us. Our mission is to protect\Nthe government’s money and catch the Demon of the Ocean. That’s right, and no matter\Nhow you look at it, there’s no doubt that\Nshe’s the Demon of the Ocean! Yeah, but I think there’s some reason\Nfor all that. I’m going to follow her and--! You’re talking nonsense. Besides, even if we were to follow her,\Nwe've got no idea where she is. No, I have one. Really, Shino? It’s something I heard. It seems there’s one island\Nin this country that played a central role in a series\Nof spiriting away incidents. Where is it?! A deserted island where\Nthe Demon of the Ocean lives, Demon Island. Demon Island? Sensei, are you doing okay? Yes, more importantly, there’s something I want to tell you\Nabout the Demon of the Ocean. The true identity of this thing called\Nthe Demon of the Ocean is a human whose flesh\Nhas been altered. What?! What did you say? Don’t muck things up like that again. Yes sir. She's out, the monster! What the…? – Get out of here.\N– You're bad luck. Take this! She's the one who was spirited away. And why would she be\Nthe only one who came back? What are you talking about? A spiriting away that occurred\Nten years ago in the Land of Sea, but that was not the working\Nof a demon. Orochimaru kidnapped humans\Nto use as live subjects for his research at the time. Orochimaru… Is Orochimaru mixed up\Nin this current matter? Wait a minute.\NOrochimaru and tests! Why are you suddenly\Nsaying such things? I have to explain it to you from\Nwhen Orochimaru left the village. Over ten years ago, Orochimaru’s desire to satisfy his own\Ninquiring mind and further his power was such that he gradually\Nexceeded the scope of a Shinobi and in the end, got involved in developing\Nwhat are called Forbidden Jutsu. How unfortunate. Naturally, this soon became\Nknown to the village. After Orochimaru! Stop that guy! But Orochimaru, who traveled\Nin and out of country on missions… had several other private facilities\Noutside of the Leaf Village… So one of those is on Demon Island? So, the people who disappeared? They were used for\Nhuman experiments. What? Damn Orochimaru!\NWhat does he think people are? So, what are we going to do? It’s obvious, isn’t it?\NWe get into their hideout! And we have to get\Nlsaribi back! It’s settled. We’ll continue and hit\Nthe Demon of the Ocean’s hideout. Sensei, how long have you known\Nabout Demon Island? It’s because Orochimaru\Nwas the Jonin in charge of me. Huh? Tell me when we get close\Nto the island. The pain is gradually getting stronger. Somebody’s coming. What shall we do? Do as you please. Yes. The arrogance…\NOne day I’ll pay him back! This way. Hurry! How is it, Shino? No problem. Okay! So, a collection ship\Nis on the move, huh? Just the right time. Good work, I was right to send you\Nback to Mother Island. What’s wrong? You’re pale. When will I return to normal? Like you said, I’ve gathered\Ninformation about the ships from the market\Nand the village, even the attacks. So… What are you bringing up, Isaribi? You can’t possibly have forgotten\Nyour role as a prototype. As a converted body,\Nyour cooperation in generating data… That was one\Nof the conditions of the promise. Don’t worry, we’ll soon be done\Ngetting data from you. I’ll keep the promise…\Nas long as I don’t change my mind. You understand, right? Yes. Well, if you understand,\Ngo keep our guests company.

The guy who was with\Nthat Kabuto?! You are correct… Of course,\NI haven’t seen him since then. You used a strange Jutsu\Nto suck up other’s Chakras.

You go ahead.\NSeems like I’m the opponent for him. Huh? His Jutsu is not suited for\Nyour style of close combat. We can’t have all three of us stay here. All right. – We’re counting on you, Shino!\N– Be careful! Wait! Parasitic Insects, eh? Found ‘im! Who? Welcome, or should I say,\Nhaven’t seen you in a while? It’s you, Amachi. I’m surprised! I can’t believe you’ve come back\Nafter something like that happened… Like what? You don’t remember? Sorry, but I have no business\Nwith you… Where is Orochimaru? Orochimaru? Don’t play dumb.\NHe’s here, isn’t he? A Curse Mark responds even\Nthough the operator isn’t around… Stuff like that happens huh? True, Orochimaru was here… But that was over half a month ago. No way. It doesn’t matter if you don’t\Nbelieve me. So the pain I felt so far… has been the influence of Orochimaru’s\Npresence here half a month ago? Wait a minute. Sensei! You two! Oh my, you brought Genin. Anko, you’re all grown up… Who is that? Amachi… a Medical Ninja\Nwho partnered with Orochimaru, and was running\Nvarious experiments here. Orochimaru’s not here.\NThis whole incident was all his doing. Him?! Hey you! How dare you run\Nthose ridiculous tests! Ridiculous? This is no joke,\NI’ve devoted my life to this research. What was that?! Look! This one has the physical ability\Nto adapt to water. She combines the ability\Nto breathe underwater and the muscle strength\Nto move freely and quickly. It’s been a dream of mine\Nfor many years, to form a Ninja corps\Nfor underwater combat. This is the first step. A Ninja corps for underwater combat? That’s right, a military corps able\Nto move freely underwater that the common person\Ndefinitely could not imitate. When that happens,\Nwe can divide land and land and completely control\Nmarine shipping routes! Wonderful, is it not? With this strength,\NI’ll stand on top of the world. And I’ll make Orochimaru regret\Nabandoning this research. People are not your tools! Oh my, you're so young, you don’t understand the greatness\Nof this research… Well, you’re average guinea pigs\Nwho don’t know any better, so I don’t think I want you to understand. Bastard! That’s good, Isaribi. Out of the way, Isaribi! No! What’s wrong? You can’t fight\Nby just running around in circles. Damn it! Why are you protecting that guy? That guy did this to you, Isaribi! Yeah, but…! But it can’t be helped. This is the only person who can\Nreturn my body back to normal. He promised. Look. Isaribi… People are judged based solely\Non their appearance. People don’t dare come near me\Njust from being covered in bandages…… A monster with these scales\Nwould be out of the question. I want to return to my former body,\NI want to be a human! For that reason,\NI decided I’d do anything! You’re a human being even now, Isaribi! Huh?! And yet you join with those guys\Nto attack and sink ships. Isn’t that far more like something\Na monster would do?! Stop it, shut up! I-I… I don’t want to hear it!\NShut up, shut up! Stop it! Are you bullying me, too? No… I-I’m the same as you! You’re lying! What are you talking about?\NYou’re a normal human. I want to be like you too! Don’t cry Isaribi…\NI’ll properly return you to normal. Watch out! A bulls-eye letter bomb.

I see, the real body made\Nits shadow clones get caught, and hid himself and\Nwaited for a chance, huh. For a small fish like that to make\Nsuch a plan in those circumstances... You're not too bad…but … You’re at the end of the line. Die! What?! Naruto, your stall was helpful. Neji! You… How…?! Substance with Chakra base… It’s meaningless in front\Nof Gentle Fist that destroys by pouring\NChakra through. That guy’s Jutsu… Evidently I’m the only one\Nwho can fight it. Go! I’ll take care of this. What’s wrong? Hey, Akamaru. Apparently, this guy’s stronger\Nthan the fatso before. Quite a bit stronger. If we’re not prepared for\N“one person, one kill,” then it’s not going to work out. That’s what you said earlier. Yeah, that’s right. Plus, we won’t be able to catch up\Nwith Sasuke if we stall here. Choji hasn’t come back either. The reason we’re doing this is because of the mission\Nto bring back Sasuke. But that’s not all. What we are after and trying\Nto protect is the bond of the Shinobi of\Nthe Village Hidden in the Leaves. Do you remember Iruka’s words\Nat the Third Hokage’s funeral? Iruka Sensei, why do people risk\Ntheir lives for others? When someone dies, they depart with their past,\Npresent and future. Many people die on missions\Nor at war. And their death is surprisingly\Nunceremonious…they simply die. Hayate was one of those people. Those who die have dreams\Nand goals, too… But everyone has things that\Nare equally important. Parents, siblings, friends, lovers,\Nthe people of their village, the people important to you. The connection to the people\Nyou trust and help mutually, the people important to you\Nfrom the day you were born. And the thread that\Nconnects you and your people gets stronger through time. It’s not a theory. That’s what a person does\Nas the thread is established because they’re important to you… Look, Sasuke is heading\Ntowards Orochimaru. We can’t let Orochimaru get\Na hold of someone from our village. Absolutely not. And… Naruto… Your eyes are better than mine. Right now, Sasuke is… in the darkness. Hurry up and go!\NI’ll catch up with you all! Gotcha! Okay! Let’s go! You along with Choji,\Nbe sure to catch up! Yeah… Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up! Heh…think I’ll let them get away?! Byakugan! Here it comes! This guy’s pretty good… Neji! That’s Neji all right! Not yet…\NI won’t let you escape that easily! I won’t let you go any further from here! It’s useless. Well, that’s fine. It seems you’re the strongest\Nout of the lot. Aw man, now I wanna play… It’s such a waste if\Na game isn't played little by little. For starters,\NI’ll play and kill you in three minutes. I got you. You’re pretty good at handling Chakra\Nand you’ve got sharp eyes. You release Chakra from\Nthe Chakra points in your hands like a sharp needle. You see the thin part of the thread\Nwith Chakra running through it, and attack. I see, I’ve heard from Lord Orochimaru… This is what’s called Gentle Fist, isn’t it? But if you can’t use\Nthose annoying hands, they can’t cut my threads either. Man, games. The instant you know\Nthe rules of engagement, they’re no longer interesting. It’s only been a minute,\Nbut I’m already tired of you. Die! Ninja Art:\NGum Style Spider Thread What?! How did he…?! I’ll explain, specially to you. It’s not just my hands I can release Chakra from\Nall of the Chakra points on my body. And it’s game over. Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.

It’ll be a matter for great celebration\Nif our pursuers get impatient, cloud their eyes of pursuit\Nand lose sight of the trail. Hurry! There’s no time. I-I know! This is not good. Though they're on\Nalert for ambushes, they’re catching up with us\Nslowly, but surely. Dang it! Probably they’re all Chunin or higher. We’ll be wiped out if they catch up. Wiped out… Dang it! Since it’s come to this,\Nwhy don’t we ambush them?! Ambush? Right. Indeed, an ambush would\Nbe to our advantage. Even if the opponent has twice\Nthe people than we do, if we just catch them off-guard… That’s no good. Our opponents are former\NLeaf Shinobi Orochimaru’s henchmen. In the worst case scenario,\Nthere might be Jonin. I thought it’d work,\Nbut I guess not, huh. Hold it. Why? The level of opponent doesn’t have\Nmuch to do with an ambush. What do you mean? You guys don’t get it. Listen. Indeed, an ambush is\Na very advantageous fundamental tactic. But two conditions are necessary. What are those necessary conditions? Number one. The ones on the run must act without\Nmaking noise and find the enemy first. Number two. One must be able to catch\Nthe pursuers off guard, capture a point and position\Nto be able to inflict certain damage, and conceal oneself quickly. Ah… Huh? An ambush only becomes effective\Nwhen these two conditions are ensured. Well, the first condition\Nwon’t be so difficult since we have the Ninja Hound’s nose. And the second one also\Nseems advantageous at a glance since we know the geography\Nof our village. But Orochimaru has spent time\Nin the Leaf before. That approach won’t work\Non his henchmen. So what do you really mean? Our pursuers must have been instructed\Nin the terrain of this village and have gone through\Nsimulated practice for this fight. And on top of that, they’re probably all Ninja\Nwho have mastered the pursuit arts. So they know what cards we have, huh. Well, even so, the fact remains\Nthat an ambush is advantageous. But there are too many elements\Nof uncertainty. In the first place, the enemy is\Na special unit organized for this operation. But we have a fool… a Kunoichi who’s nothing special… and one dog… and, me with the number-one cold feet! A tactic is grasping the conditions\Nthat are there without fail and formulating an optimal plan. And so, there’s only one thing\Nthat we can do now… One? A diversion in the guise\Nof an ambush. One person will remain,\Npretend to ambush, and delay the pursuers. In other words… bait. Right. If we delay them, they won’t be able to grasp\Nthe positions of the remaining three. If we do that, we’ll be able\Nto shake off our pursuers, but the one who has become\Nthe bait will probably… die. So, who’s going to do it? We need the dog to follow Sasuke. That means… Fine… – I'll…\N– I guess it has to be me. Shikamaru?! W-Why you?! It’s better than being wiped out, right? Besides, among us, the only one who is equal\Nto playing the bait and who has the possibility\Nof surviving… is me. Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Art\Noriginally intended as a delay tactic, so… Well, I’ll catch up later! Now get going! We’re counting on you, Shikamaru! Sakura! Yeah. Was Shikamaru ever this reliable\Nof a character? Be careful… Shikamaru. No matter how much you try to erase\Nthe signs of your presence… you’re in plain view. Hey! The enemy is approaching fast. What did you say?! I wonder if he’s really\Ndelaying the enemy. Me with the number-one cold feet! Don’t tell me, Shikamaru… Shikamaru will be okay! Don’t tell me, he ran away. I said he’ll be okay! What’ll be okay?! He has a dirty mouth and\Nalways says stuff is a pain. But he wouldn’t betray us! He hardly ever says\Nhe’ll do something himself, but he makes sure to do it\Nif he says it! That’s absolute. I want to believe…\NI want to believe, but… Pick up the pace! I somehow managed to\Nget away completely. Their strides are irregular. Urgency is probably increasing\Ntheir fatigue. Sorry about that. I was supposed to be the guy\Nwith the number one cold feet. It seems my character has\Nchanged just a bit this time. The fact that I’m tired is true. Those footprints are wrong. By the way, this is what\Nthe dog’s paw print really is. Oh, he’s still a kid. To think we’d all get caught like this. So this is the rumored Leaf Village’s\NShadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh? That’s an old way of saying it! The times are passing! It’s called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,\Nold man. Sure enough,\Nthat match wasn’t good. I used too much Chakra.\NI can’t hang on much longer… 1, 2, 3, 4… 5, 6, 7…8. Eight people… Eight… No, there’s one more… There are nine people following us. Sure enough, the ninth person’s role is\Nto protect against them getting ambushed. That person stays at a fixed distance, moves in the back and responds\Nto an enemy attack. But…this will make clear where\Nthat person’s hiding! There, huh?! Dang it… The Shadow won’t reach. I don’t have the stamina to\Nsend it to Chakra. It’s futile. I see through your technique. Is this as far as it goes? It looks like you’re at your limit… This Shadow Possession Jutsu\Nis going to break very soon. Prepare yourself! I wanted to…\Nbecome a Ninja any which way, save up money any which way, get married any which way to\Nan ordinary woman who’s neither beautiful nor ugly and have two kids any which way. First will be a girl, and then a boy… I would retire from being a Ninja\Nwhen my eldest daughter marries and my son becomes a full-fledged man. And then I take it easy\Nin my life of retirement playing Japanese chess\Nand Go the whole day. Then I die of old age before my wife. Such a life would’ve been nice. I was out of character,\NI tried too hard this time. I wanted it to end in an ordinary way. What I did was a drag… Hmm, the movements of\Nour pursuers have stopped. Yes! The delaying was a success! Shikamaru, eh? I’m sorry I doubted you, even a little. Okay! Now…you wait, Sasuke. And…Shikamaru… Live, and catch up to us no matter what! As you say, it seems I’m at my limit. Hey, come on out. While you’re at it, cut off his head. I finally caught up. A-Asuma?! Why? Well done, Shikamaru. Sure enough, out of character. For the time being, you retire here. Hurry! What a pest.

Hey… Naruto… Those are called…cockroaches. Huh? Cockroaches? You're comparing apples to oranges. This thing is completely different! They look exactly identical to me… – They’re not!\N– They're not! Depending on how one looks of it,\Nthis could be an opportunity. What do you mean, Suzumebachi? It’s been ten days since we came here… we haven’t been able to get\Nany leads on the Bikochu. However, that kid from\Nthe Abarame Clan might… That makes sense! You mean they might be able\Nto catch a Bikochu… From their appearance,\Nit seems they're all Genin. If they're able to catch\Na Bikochu… we'll just take it from them. All insects look alike. Insect Summoning Jutsu! There aren’t any…here… This thing here\Nis different too, huh… Huh? Don’t be a burden to everyone… This mission\Nis something that I suggested… so I will find it without fail! Byakugan! Just as I thought… it’s difficult to perceive things\Nas small as insects. Huh?! Shino! Kiba! Hinata…Did you notice too? So…you did too? I guess…they think they’re hiding… Unfortunately for them, we have a whole array of specialists\Nin detecting enemies. What should we do, Shino?\NYou’re the leader of this mission. If we end up in a battle,\Nthere’s the danger of involving the insects… and injuring the Bikochu. As long as they don't make a move,\Nwe'll just watch them closely. Got it. I wonder if…Naruto noticed. If he had noticed,\Nhe would have raised a big clamor. I don’t want to stir things up.\NSo don’t tell him. Okay… Hey, Shino! Shino! I found it! I found it! I’m telling you,\NI found a Bikochu! He found it already?! That’s impossible! When we spent ten days searching\Nand couldn’t find one…! Awesome, Naruto… Are you sure, Naruto? Let me see it. See…this is it, right? It’s exactly like the photo, right? I might be an insect-hunting genius. Huh? Does it look the same to you? Huh? That’s called a goliath beetle… Huh?! It’s not the same thing?! Bikochu aren’t active at night. Which means that… Let’s call it a day then. Shino… Shino! I found one!\NThis time there’s no mistake! It’s probably a completely\Ndifferent insect again. Naruto… Yeah! There’s no mistake! Over here! Over here! If you don’t hurry,\Nit’ll fly off somewhere! Hey, didn’t you bring it with you? I found one that’s resting in a tree. The shape of its feelers is certainly\Nthe same as Bikochu. And all the characteristics match. They do, don't they?\NThere’s no mistake it’s this thing, right?! B-But…Naruto… This thing is different after all, isn’t it? Why is that? It's not only size! How would you make\Nthis one sniff scents?! Like this! This thing is called\Na Fake Bikochu. It has an extremely\Nviolent temperament… It gets angry if one touches its nose\Nand sometimes even eats humans… What? Huh? Hey, Shino! Didn’t you say\Nthere weren’t any dangerous insects! Almost none… but not zero. Kurobachi… Jibachi… Do you really think they'll be able\Nto catch a Bikochu? – That might be difficult…\N– That might be difficult… Unless I control my Chakra\Nmore perfectly I won’t be able to find something\Nas small as an insect! To come all this way and\Ncontinue training… That’s quite admirable… The air pressure has changed. That’s a sure sign that\Nthe weather will change. Yeah, I realize that. A wind charged with moisture\Nhas started blowing… This means\Nthere’s gonna be rainfall. When it’s such good weather? But I can see clouds off in the distance… Hinata… We need to hurry. Because it’s said that the Bikochu\Nonly lays an egg when it rains and larva emerges from the egg\Nthe following morning. In other words, if it rains today, it'll become\Na mature larva tomorrow morning. In view of the season,\Nthis may well be our last chance. If this chance slips by, it will become impossible to search\Nfor Sasuke using a Bikochu… Sasuke… It’ll be fine.\NI’ll find it without fail! Don’t rain… Don’t rain yet! Damn! Where is it?! Please come on out\Nbefore it rains! Naruto… What are we gonna do… if those guys don’t find\Na Bikochu, Suzumebachi? It was the Aburame Clan who was the catalyst in\Nthe downfall of the Kamizuru Clan… In order to avenge our clan's\Nlongstanding grudge… we will finish them off! Those guys…\NThey haven’t made a move yet. They must know that we’re searching\Nfor the Bikochu. Which means that they must be waiting\Nfor us to find one. I see…So their plan is to steal it\Nfrom us once we’ve found one... What cheapskates… Rain… Not this one either! Damn! When I told it not to rain! There's no more time… Don’t be a burden to everyone… So ultimately…\NI contributed nothing. There’s still plenty of time! Naruto… I will not go back on my word…\NThat’s my Way of Ninja! That’s right… This mission is something\NI suggested! When Naruto hasn’t given up,\Nwhat’s up with me giving up?! Hinata! This rain may be\Nvery advantageous to you. What do you mean? When the surrounding temperature cools, living creatures become\Neasier to discern. Naruto, I won’t give up either! Byakugan! I have to…\NI have to concentrate more… I need to… I need to…\Ncontrol my Chakra! I can see them!\NSo those are insects! That insect…is wrong… This insect is wrong too. That’s…! There it is! Naruto! On the side of that tree!\NThere’s a Bikochu there! I caught it! We did it…! I did it! I caught it! There’s no mistake.\Nlt’s a female Bikochu. – Yes! I did it! 					– Cripes… Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto! That’s so great, Naruto! Hinata! It’s thanks to you! Naruto…is…hugging me…! What’s the matter, Akamaru? All right! It’s an egg! It laid an egg, huh… Really? It will emerge by tomorrow… So then we should make it\Nrecognize Sasuke’s scent, right?! Sasuke… I’ll find you without fail! It looks like they finally found one… The time has come, hasn’t it? Yeah… That Naruto… He suddenly… pressed his face so close to mine… So…you were able\Nto dodge that one just now. That was pretty well done\Nfor a Genin. They’re the ones who’ve\Nbeen trailing us all this time… However, I wonder if you’ll be able\Nto escape from this attack? Ninja Art…Honey Jutsu! Bees?! No… that’s…! It looks like you’ve noticed, huh.\NThat’s honey. Honey that adheres like a bonding agent! I used up all my Chakra earlier… That thing is a real bee. Naruto… What do you think, Akamaru? I see… I was convinced that those guys\Nwould make some kind of move. There hasn’t been any sign\Nof them since earlier on… There’s a possibility that\Nwe’ve overlooked something. Hey, Naruto! Huh? Where’s Hinata? She said she was gonna\Ngo wash her face. Hmm… But it’s been quite some time.\NI wonder what she’s doing? Could it be that…?! Huh? What? – Naruto! 					– Wha--?! A letter on a Kunai? Huh?! We are holding the Kunoichi\Nbrat hostage. If you want to get her back, it’ll be in exchange for\Nthe Bikochu. Come to the top of\Nthe eastern hill later tonight. Damn! So that was their move! Hinata…! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah Damn! We've run out of options! It's too soon to give up. But we don't even know\Nwhere Hinata is?! No, there's one place Hinata\Nis sure to appear. I get it! The place where\Nthe exchange will take place! We have one chance. Awright! I'll do it! I'll protect Hinata and\Nthe Faint Scent Beetle without fail!

23,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart I see. Sakura, you've come, too. Now you can formally register\N for the Chunin Exam. What do you mean? Actually, from the start, only three-man squads could\Napply and take the exams. But Sensei, you said that the decision\Nto take the exams was up to the individual. Yes… I said that. Were you lying? Yes, I was… If I said that, Sasuke and Naruto would probably\Nforcefully convince you to take it. Even if you didn't have\Nthe will to apply, if Sasuke asks you you would attempt to take\Nthe exams half-heartedly. For Sasuke's sake and,\Nwell, Naruto's. Then, if… it had only been Sasuke and\NNaruto who had come here? I would've stopped the Exam here. I wouldn't have felt like letting\Nthem go beyond this point. But…you guys came here\Non your own will. Sakura! Naruto! And, Sasuke! I'm glad you came. You're a team I'm proud of. Now then, go on! Okay! Let's go! Genin Takedown!\NAll Nine Rookies Face Off! W-Wow! W-What's with…this? There are so many of them… Could it be that they're all applicants? They…all look…immensely strong… Sasuke, you're late! I thought I'd be able to see you\Nfor the first time in awhile, so I was waiting in excitement. Get away from Sasuke!\Nlno-Pig! Oh, my. It's Sakura. Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh…\NUgly! What did you say?! What's up with this? Huh? Are you guys going to take\Nthis bothersome Exam, too? Oh, it's the idiot trio. Quit calling us that! Man, this is a freaking bother… Shikamaru Nara. Always complaining,\Nhas no motivation. He's a bellyaching idiot. Choji Akimichi. He's always eating something. That's all he is, a fat idiot. Sasuke…is mine. Bleah! Ino Yamanaka. She's always fighting with Sakura.\NShe's her rival. A Sasuke-crazy idiot. Yahoo, I found you! My my, everybody's here. H-Hello… Oh… Hinata Hyuga. She's a weird person who turns\Nher eyes away whenever I look at her! She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess. Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru. They're louder than I am! He always brings his dog and\Nalways has a bossy look. He really annoys me! Shino Aburame. As for this guy, I really don't get him! He's a type I'm not good with. What did you say? You guys, too?! 					 Man. Ha! I see. This means all nine Genin rookies\Nare taking the Exam, eh…! Now then… How far can we go? Eh…Sasuke? Hmph!… You're mighty confident. Kiba. We've trained a great deal, so... We won't lose to you guys! Shut up! I don't know about Sasuke,\Nbut I sure won't lose to the likes of you! I'm sorry. Naruto… Kiba didn't mean it like that… Huh? Akamaru, you've become\Ntasty-looking… What? Don't step on it. Huh? I said, don't step on it. You're…gonna eat that? Hey, you guys! You should be a little quieter. You guys are the ""rookie nine"" …\Nfresh out of the academy, right? Carrying on like that\Nwith cute faces…Man. This isn't a field trip. Who're you? Acting all haughty! I'm Kabuto Yakushi.\NAnyway, take a good look around you. Behind you…\NThey're from the Rain Village. They're hot-tempered. Everyone's tense before the Exam. I thought I'd warn you guys\Nbefore you get your butts whipped… I guess it can't be helped. You're rookies who don't know\Nleft from right… You remind me of my old self. You're Kabuto…right? Yes… Then, is this your second time? No… It's my seventh time. Huh?! This Exam is only held twice a year,\Nso it's now my fourth year. Then that means you know\Na lot about these exams?! Kind of… No kidding.\NKabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh? But you haven't passed. Yeah, well, that is the case, yes… Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle? Man, this is utterly bothersome… Then, maybe I'll give a bit of\Ninformation to my cute juniors. With these Ninja Info Cards. Ninja Info Cards…? To put it simply, they're cards that have information burned\Ninto them and coded with Chakra. I spent four whole years gathering\Ninformation for this Exam. There are close to two hundred\Nof these cards. They are pure white to the eye… To open the data on these cards... What're you doing? The way it works is that\Nno one can see the info without using my Chakra… For example…Like this… \Whoa, awesome!\NWhat information is this? The number of test-takers and\Nparticipating nations, and the number of applicants\Nfrom each respective village is individually displayed. Why do you think that the Chunin Exam is jointly\Nconducted in the first place? It's said it's done to deepen\Nfriendship among nations first and to boost the Shinobi levels, second. ""It's said""? That's right. The real aim is in the checking of\NShinobi levels of neighboring nations and keeping power balance equal. Power…Equal? Why such bothersome things? If that's not done, the weak nations will be invaded by\Nthe strong nations in no time at all and may end up being\Ncontrolled unilaterally. There's a point to mutual supervision.\NProbably. Hmph… Of those cards, are there ones with\Ndetailed individual information? Yes, there are… Are there ones you're concerned about? Yes, there are! The information for the applicants\Nthis time around is not perfect, but is burned in and saved. You guys included… About those ""ones you're\Nconcerned about,"" who you know. Anything's fine, tell me their information\Nand I'll retrieve it for you. Gaara of the Sand Village,\Nand Rock Lee of the Leaf Village. Oh, you even know names. That makes it quick. Here they are! Please show me. Here they are! Please show me. I don't really get what's going on,\Nbut I'll pretend like I do. Well then, first is Rock Lee. He's one year older than you guys. His mission experience,\Ntwenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks. His squad leader is Guy… In just this year, his Taijutsu\Nhas drastically improved, but... His other skills are not good at all. Last year, he'd attracted attention as\Na Genin rookie with his ability, but didn't participate\Nin the Chunin Exam. This is his first time taking the exams,\Nsame as you guys… Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team… Huh? Hyuga? Next…is Gaara of the Desert. His mission experience,\Neight C-ranks. B-ranks… Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh… He's a Shinobi from a different land\Nand is a rookie, so there is no further\Ndetailed information. But… It seems he has returned from\Nall of his missions uninjured. B-rank as a Genin…\NBut uninjured…?! What is this guy? Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,\NWaterfall, Sound… There are lots of exceptional Genins\Nfrom those villages who have come to take\Nthe Exam this year as well. As far as the Village Hidden\Nin Sound goes, it's a village of a small nation that\Njust sprang up in recent years, so there isn't much information… At any rate, they're all Hidden Villages\Nwith nothing but crackerjacks. That kind of makes you lose\Nyour confidence. Why are you saying that now? In other words… all of the applicants who\Nhave gathered here… That's right! Not just Lee and Gaara, but they're all choice top elite\NGenin from each nation. Hmm. This isn't going to be easy. I can't go along with this! They may be your subordinates now, but they are children\Nwho were my students. If it's about them I know… It's as you say, Iruka. It's not going to be that easy. You're too eager. I postponed my team's test-taking\Nfor one year and took care to build up\Ntheir skills. Have them take the Exam after\Nthey've enjoyed their life a little bit more. Hmph… They might be too easygoing. But they will surpass\Nyour guys in no time. That's enough. That's as far as\Nthe rookie matter goes. Now then, next… I'll take recommendations for Genin\Nother than rookies. Well! Don't pour cold water on this… I said that, nevertheless… I wonder if even the fearless ones\Nare frightened just this time around. Stubborn as he is, he's still consumed by this atmosphere\Nand number of people. He's tense. It can't be helped. Even though everyone is a Genin,\Nwe're the newest most inexperienced rookies. I'm very, very uneasy. But… It's kind of tough looking at\NNaruto who's not himself. Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit. Say…Naruto! Don't be so scared. Huh? My name's Naruto Uzumaki! I won't lose to any of you!\NGot it?! Say! What's with him?! That idiot would never\Nget depressed! Absurd! It won't do any good to\Nprovoke everyone! Don't tell me! If I don't tell it to you,\Nwho do I tell it to?! What did you say?! Oh, I feel better. Hmph… Isn't that the guy from before…? The dog's bark is\Nbigger than its bite. Is he an idiot…? He's mighty high-spirited. He's hot-headed, eh. Lee, maybe you did\Nnot bully him enough. Did you hear? Sound Village is a minor\NHidden Village of a small nation. That's offensive. Maybe I'll…play with them a bit. Yes, being referred to as something\Nlike leftover Shinobis and all. We'll add this to his data. Those Sound Shinobis\Nare brutal in their own way. I won't lose to any of you,\Nyou say? You said it…! That idiot… In no time at all, he's made enemies\Nof his surroundings. What're you talking big for?! You! But, I just said what was true, I say! E-Everyone, that was a joke. This guy's quite an idiot, you see… After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,\Nscatterbrained things and gets carried away, so please don't concern\N yourself with him. Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at! I'm going to kick your butt! Shall we do it? Let's do it. Learn how to read atmosphere\Nalready, you! Fine! These guys…are the Sound Village… He dodged it! I can see through that speed. I see… It's that kind of attack, eh? What's going on? He was supposed to have evaded it. Why'd that happen to his glasses? Probably grazed the tip of his nose. He's trying to act strong, so. That punk. Huh?! Oh! He puked?! K-Kabuto? Huh?! Hah! Hey, Kabuto! Are you okay?! Yeah…I'm okay. Really? Oh, so he's not so special. Even though he's a veteran who's\Nbeen taking the exams for four whole years. Write this on your card. The three from Sound village…\NDoubtless Chunin. Kabuto should've totally read the attack… But why did he vomit? Lee. How about that technique just now? I had no problem reading the speed. There's some kind of trick... Silence! Degenerates! Sorry to keep you waiting…I I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the\Nfirst test of the Chunin Exam. It feels like the chance to show off\Nthe fruits of our training has finally come. Well, no matter what kind\Nof test it is, it's gonna be a snap! I'm picturing Sasuke and them\Nbowing to me and saying, ""Naruto, we're really no match for you."" Huh? Is this for real?!

184,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain What do you mean by\Nmonitoring Akamaru? You know about the incident where someone from outside\Ninfiltrated the village, right? Yeah, I know about that. But I heard that Kiba and the others\Nresolved that incident without any trouble. That’s right. Damn! That Kiba! I want a mission where\NI totally kick an enemy’s butt. To be exact, that’s wrong. What? Before Kiba and the others\Nhad the intruder in custody… he swallowed a pellet\Nand killed himself. What? Suicide…? In the investigation that followed, it was revealed that the enemy\Nwas a Shinobi from another land that uses\Na unique tactic. Perhaps he took his own life\Nin order to seal that power. What’s the “unique” tactic? Something you would call\Na biological weapon. Biological weapon? It’s a particular pathogen… a terrible weapon where someone\Ninfected will gradually lose oneself and have their body taken over. But how is that connected\Nwith monitoring Akamaru? Could it be that Akamaru was…?! There’s a possibility he’s infected. He still doesn’t look so well. Y-Yeah… Since Akamaru’s not\Nin his best condition, I’m skipping training today as well. Okay… Oh! Wh-What’re you doing, Shino?! Shino, do something quick! Shino! The insects suddenly\Nstopped listening to me. Jeez, give me a break. I’m sorry. We’ll head back early\Nfor the time being. See ya. I hope… Akamaru gets better soon. Shino? It’s the first time the insects\Nhave attacked a comrade… What is it, Akamaru? Oh, shoot! I’ve been spotted! What’re you doing, Naruto? Wh-What, you ask? I’m developing a new Jutsu,\Nbelieve it! So as for me, I’m busy and… Kiba's Long Day Is there no mistake, Sis? I’d say the possibility\Nat this point is around fifty-fifty. I still haven’t been able to identify it, but these are the lab results of\Nthe blood drawn from Akamaru… But! It could be some kind of mistake! Do you think I, a veterinarian,\Nwould make such a mistake? Yeah… You’re right. What is it, Akamaru?! Let go! Let go! Akamaru, it’s Naruto. It’s okay to let go. Hey, Akamaru! Akamaru! What did you do that for Akamaru? I mean, what’re you doing\Nin the front yard of my house? Huh? Well, that’s… Anyway, come in. For the time being, I have to fulfill\Nmy responsibility as the owner. What? What?! Geez! Biting a comrade\Nof the same village can’t be allowed! Are you training him properly, Kiba?! All right. It’s finished! Perfect if\NI do say so myself! Sis! That looks just like\Na surgical scar! What? Really?\NI thought it turned out well, though… Sorry, Naruto. Have Sakura or someone\Npatch them up for you! Hm? Right… See ya. Right. See you later too, Miss Hana! Akamaru… I’m telling you, there’s nothing else other than\Nmy pants getting all torn up. Shino’s insects attacked Akamaru… He even attacked Naruto, whom\Nhe should know very well. There’s trouble, Lady Tsunade! It seems they were attacked\Nby someone in the middle of night training. Looks like they launched\Na sneak attack with quite a few men. No, it seems there was just one culprit. What?! All of this by one person?! To be precise, that’s not correct. It’s one animal. There’s no doubt. There’s trouble, Kiba! You’re talking about the incident where Shinobi were attacked during\Nnight training last night, right…? It-It can’t be! It seems it’s as you said, Sis… I can smell blood from Akamaru. That’s Kiba Inuzuka’s\NNinja Hound Akamaru, correct? You jerks.\NWhat do you want with Akamaru?! A warrant…? Kiba…! Yes, there’s no mistake. Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage, the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept under the supervision\Nof the Anbu Black Ops. – Damn it! 					– Kiba! We should obey\Nthe Lady Hokage’s order. Damn it! Akamaru… Here. Thanks, Sis. This contains medicine that I prepared, so give it to the vet over there. Right. I’m off, then. Naruto…? What’s the idea of Akamaru\Nbeing detained?! Akamaru is the culprit from\Nlast night’s incident. We have sufficient proof as well. At this point, it’s an unavoidable measure. The Medical Team is now desperately\Nlooking for a way to save Akamaru. Don’t worry too much. If…that doesn’t work either,\Nwhat’ll happen to Akamaru? At that time… there’ll be nothing left to do\Nbut to put Akamaru down! Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital You don’t need to worry. The Medical Corps will figure\Nsomething out soon. Right… Take care on your way home. Right. Akamaru… I won’t hand you over to anyone. It seems Kiba Inuzuka\Nhas taken Akamaru and fled. Lady Tsunade, what shall we do? In preparation for the worst, have the Special Pursuit Corps\Nstand by here! The Special Pursuit Corps… C-Could it be that you’re really\Ngoing to kill Akamaru…Grandma? Grandma Tsunade! It’s hard for me, too. Damn it! Did you find them?! No! Kiba! Kiba! He’s rapidly getting worse. Akamaru! Where are they? They should be around here. I swore to protect him,\Nno matter what! I swore never I’d never let him go through\Nthat experience ever again…! The Special Pursuit Corps\Nhas assembled. Show the team in. Kiba! Where are you?! I guess I was able to hide\Nmy tracks somewhat… This is a serum for Akamaru\Nthat the Medical Corps whipped up. I can’t guarantee the level of effect. There’s maybe a fifty-percent chance\Nof survival. There’s also a risk of side-effects that would cause Akamaru\Nto go even more berserk. In the event that happens… It’s an unavoidable measure,\Nbut Akamaru must… Reporting! The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has\Nlost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru. Lady Tsunade. That way?! Akamaru… Kiba! Wh-What’s that? It’s Akamaru… But… I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone! What’re you doing?! Have you come to kill Akamaru?! No! I just came out of concern! You lie! The Lady Hokage said it,\Ndidn’t she?! There’ll be nothing else to do\Nbut to kill Akamaru. You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?! I won’t hand over Akamaru\Nto anyone! This isn’t the time\Nto be doing that! Something called the Special Pursuit Corps\Nor whatever is coming after Akamaru! What?! The Pursuit Corps should\Nbe here soon. Akamaru will really be\Nin trouble if that happens! You and I have to do\Nsomething before that! This isn’t the time to be fighting! Shut up! Why don’t you get it, Kiba?! Shut up! All right! I’ve sighted Akamaru! Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back! C-Could it be…the Pursuit Corps is… Sis! You gotta be… joking, right? Sis! What’re you going to do\Nto Akamaru with that? This is medicine I received\Nfrom the Hokage. I’m going to inject it into Akamaru. Then Akamaru will be saved?! The probability is fifty-fifty. If it fails and side-effects are produced, Akamaru’s symptoms will\Nget even worse. All we can do now is take\Na chance on this. If the worst happens and it fails… You understand, right, Kiba? Damn it… Even if it’s only fifty percent, there’s a possibility that Akamaru\Nwill be saved. We’ve gotta do this!\NI’ll also help out, miss! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Kiba, what about you?! If you’re not going to do anything,\Nyou’re in the way, so beat it! Let’s go, Kiba. Just leave that coward be. You’re ready, right?\NLet’s go, Naruto! We’ll save you now, Akamaru! Aim for the legs!\Nlmmobilize Akamaru! Right! Since it’s come to this,\NI have no choice. I must terminate Akamaru. Stop! I said stop… Akamaru. Kiba! Kiba? Akamaru… Have you forgotten…my scent? We were always together from\Nwhen we were little, weren’t we? Akamaru… Why…why…did you become like this? Please remember… Akamaru! Kiba! I'm sorry, Akamaru… I put you through nothing but\Npainful experiences. I’m sorry, Akamaru…\NI couldn’t protect you… I’m sorry… Akamaru… I'm a terrible master. But… I’ll…always be with you. Kiba… Kiba! It really would’ve been touch and go if the Medical Corps had been\Neven a little late in arriving. Without a doubt, he would’ve lost his life if Akamaru’s attack\Nhad hit Kiba’s vital spot… Really, it could have been\Nmuch worse. That’s wrong… Huh? Kiba?! When he came at me with\Nhis final attack, Akamaru just barely missed\Nmy vital spots. He drained all his remaining strength\Nin order to desperately control himself.

I’ve done it!\NThe water is turning! It seems it’s going to be easier\Nthan I thought to break it. Then I’ll go take a little rest\Nuntil it’s done…with this. Hey! What is that?! I need it to kill the time.\NAnd also to get some sleep. Huh! The way it’s going,\Nit won’t even be an afternoon nap! Is that so…?\NCall me when it is broken. Just wait! If it keeps up like this,\NI’ll learn it within today! Keep on Training!\NPop Goes the Water Balloon Oh man! Why doesn’t it break! Huh? Are you done with it? Ah…well, it’s almost done\Nor how should I call it. Oh boy… It seems like I went beyond\Nan afternoon nap and had a deep sleep. Hey, hey…how do I break it? Didn’t I tell you I can’t give\Na detailed explanation until it’s broken? All right, I understand… Naturally, you’re supposed to realize it\Nthrough trial and error when mastering a Jutsu, but… Yeah, yeah. I guess I’ll teach you just\Na tiny bit on the Jutsu… You, try rotating the water! Oh, okay. Right or left…which direction did you\Nimagine when you rotate it? Hmm…well, to the left… Hey, come over here. Okay… Huh, I thought so… W-What? You are in fact a right-rotation type. Right? In order to build up Chakra, it is necessary to blend the energy… Chakra\N							Spiritual energy       Physical energy\N		So everybody unconsciously builds up\N		Chakra inside the body by rotating it.\N55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20\N              Right                             Left\N		Whether the rotation at that point\N		is to the right or to the left differs in the individual. Therefore, if you imagine\Nthe rotation of the water balloon opposite to that of your rotation-type\Nin this training, your Chakra flow divides and resists and the momentum of\Nthe rotation does not get on track. You should be able to figure\Nthat kind of stuff on your own. But how did you figure out that\NI’m a right-type so fast? The cowlick on your head! It's pretty much determined that you’re\Na right type if a whorl rolls to the right and you’re a left-type\Nif it rolls to the left. It’s simple. Huh, so I have a right roll! Yes, so if you want to rotate it,\Nyou have to imagine a right rotation. I never really paid attention\Nthat until now… But this Jutsu is just the one for you. Hand sign is completely unnecessary.\NAll you need is Chakra. There is no need to learn\Na finicky hand sign! It’s okay to be stupid! I’m not stupid! I’m the man who’s eventually going\Nto become a Hokage! It’s easy once you understand! This Jutsu, I’ll completely master it\Nif I got three days! Three days, huh? This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu\Nthat the Fourth Hokage passed on to us. Huh…? It took him three whole years\Nto perfect this Jutsu… This Jutsu is second from the top on the six degrees of\Ndifficulty in mastering… It’s an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu. In order to learn this move,\Nthere are three steps in the training. This “Water Balloon Breaking”\Nis the first step. It took the genius Ninja,\Nthe Fourth Hokage… Three years… There’s no point in explaining\Nanymore to someone who can’t even clear the first step. Do the rest by yourself! Take care!\NI’m going to return to the town. I have to gather some information… What will you do? A-rank in degree of difficulty\Nin mastering… The Ninjutsu left behind\Nby the Fourth Hokage… I’m not gonna go back yet! Huh… So long… Don’t go overboard with it. Now, what will happen? It’s something to be concerned about… Mister! Why don’t you stop by? This month is our special service month. Whoa! It’s a special service month? The more you visit,\Nthe more you benefit. Here you go, a stamp card! I’ll give you lots and lots of service! I’ll come, I’ll come! Hey! Come on down, Shu! Hey, hey, where is the toilet? I don’t have time to spend three years. All right now! Training, once again today!\NI’m gonna work hard like a blaze! Break! Break! Break! Why won’t it break? Little Jiraiya, you’re so naughty! Men are all naughty! Dang it! Three days have passed since\NI got the tip from that Pervy Sage… The rubber is stretched this much,\Nbut why won’t it break? What am I doing different from\Nthat Pervy Sage? This is great! This is so great! What the--? Whoa, he stinks of alcohol. I’m gonna eat now! Huh? What's the matter? Oh dang it! Darn it! Why is it like this?! No need to learn a finicky hand sign!\Nlt’s okay to be stupid! He said that there’s no need to form\Na hand signal, but… Hey! That’s not your toy… This is it! Hurry up and wake up!\NHey, you Pervy Sage! Uh… G-Good timing. Why don’t you bring me some water… Water? The first step is cleared! Cleared…? Well, let’s have you show it to me. All right! Watch it carefully! Left hand? Go! All right! See that?! See that?! You’re sleeping! Sorry, sorry. I’m tired from the days and nights\Nof gathering information. But that seems suspicious to begin with! You still stink of alcohol too! Nevertheless… You rotate the water inside the water balloon\Nthat you hold in your left hand by repeatedly applying it\Nwith your right hand… It seems little strange of an idea, but… You’re an interesting kid. You understood the trick pretty well.\Nlt’s all thanks to me, though. It’s thanks to this guy! Huh? I realized after I saw this cat playing\Nwith the water balloon. He kept on flicking it with\Nhis paw many times and the water inside shocked\Nin all different kinds of direction… Then it came to me like “bingo!” How did it come like “bingo”? The time when the Pervy Sage\Nfirst showed me breaking it… I remembered how the water balloon\Nsurface was not smooth. Until then,\NI was always only rotating the water in the one same direction… I realized that the Pervy Sage’s\Nwater balloon was not smooth because the water inside was rotating\Nin different directions. And after doing it in my own way,\Nit broke! It seems it’s still not possible for you to rotate it violently with one hand, but… I suppose you thought it out\Nin your own way. That’s just what he expected of me! Anyhow…\NThe first step is complete for now. All right! Do you want to see it one more time?\NOne more time! Oww! You used too much Chakra and\Nit gradually reached the point where there’s burden\Non the Chakra Network… But the next one won’t be like this! Okay. Now, we will proceed\Nto the second step. Yeah! It seems like we can finally go\Ninto some serious training! – Here you go! 					– Huh? Rubber ball?\NSomething like this again?! Now, you’ll break this one! It’s one hundred times harder\Nthan the water balloon! It’s hard… The first step is rotation,\Nthe second step is force. Since there is no water inside, it’s more difficult to imagine\Nthe rotation of Chakra, so it becomes more difficult\Nto rotate the Chakra as well. That’s true… I’ll leave that to your own judgment. I need to learn a trick again\Nto do this, don’t I? Well then,\NI’ll go gather some information. Hey! Wait, wait! Let’s train together for\Nthe first time in a while! I don’t mind if you take a nap. Don’t depend on me! You must have some kind\Nof misunderstanding! I did say that I’ll teach you the Jutsu, but I don’t have the obligation\Nto teach you every step of the way. If you can’t do it by yourself,\Nthen that’s it. Don’t be childish forever…\NBecome more respectable like a Shinobi! Well, well then. If you can at least teach me…\Nthe trick again… Money! Money…money…money… W-What do you mean\N“be respectable like a Shinobi”?! Even though you say that,\Nyou’re an dirty and greedy adult! You’re not a respectable Shinobi at all! It’s way more difficult than\Nthe time with the water balloon… A-And… my hands and arms hurt. Dang it! How many days am I\Ngoing to be doing the same thing! Second from the top in\N the difficulty of mastering… Don’t depend on me! You must have some kind\Nof misunderstanding! Dang it! Hey, Naruto. What did you come here for? Go buy some food from the town below. What?! Why me? Hey you… Even if for a while, you’re still\Nlearning the Jutsu from me. Here you go, thanks for waiting. Thank you. How dare he put on a master’s face\Nonly at a time like this when he doesn’t teach me anything… Dad, buy me some ice cream. I want this one that cracks. Here. Why? I can eat all of it by myself. Nope, when you get home,\Nyour mother will have supper ready. Okay! Hey…you know… Huh? Can you be around my training\Nfor just a while…today? I don’t have time for that. I have to immediately go to town. Unless you think for yourself and\Nget a grip of the trick for yourself, it’ll never work. I thought I told you three weeks ago! Don’t be spoiled like a kid.\NYou are a Ninja. I know that without\Nyour telling me! Just thought I'd ask. Hurry up and go,\Nyou Pervy Sage! Oh no, little Jiraiya,\Nyou tell so many lies! What do you mean?!\NEverything is true! Dang it! It doesn’t break\Nno matter how much I try… I’m just dripping away\Nmy Chakra this way. Also… The more I increase the amount of flow,\Nthe worse the pain gets. But… How do I say it? If I don’t go all out as if\Nto explode the Chakra, it’s not going to break! That’s it! If I understand the amount of Chakra\Nthat flows from the pain I feel… Then I can bear the pain to the limit\Nand all at once… No, not yet… Not yet! Not yet…store it! Now! Oww! Hmm… There seems to have been\Na little progress. Humph! I’ve still only opened a hole\Nand it hasn’t popped with a bang! Hey, don’t pretend to be so tough. Here! You’ve done well,\Nall on your own power. It’s so good! Yes… Oh yeah. Maybe we’ll test a bit. What, what? Give me your right hand. What’s this? A cycle of hardship, right?

No longer... can I make things\Nblow up in my face! Don’t... underestimate me! An ace in the hole is something\Nyou set aside, right?! An ace in the hole is something\Nyou set aside, right? What?! He could already\Nuse his right arm?! So the first half of the battle was\Na strategic move to make us think he couldn’t\Nuse his right arm. Not bad…Zaku. What’s your purpose? The recently built Sound Village.\NThat’s my village, you see… You already understand, don’t you…? Humph! Ridiculous ambition. Oh, my… you said it. But, for that I need various pieces\Nwho will obey my every whim. Take this! So Sasuke is one of those pieces? No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece. And the ones who are taking\Nthe exams now… are mere throw-away pieces. My arms! What’s this?! Earlier when I recommended\Nthat you give up… as a precautionary measure,\NI gave a suggestion to the bugs… to block that troublesome wind hole\Nwith their bodies and remain still. This is what a real ace in the hole is. Punk! Don’t…come any closer... to Sasuke! Even if you’re one of\Nthe legendary three Ninja, at the least,\NI can kill you as you kill me! What’s funny? What you say and what you do,\Nare all off. What? There’s no point at all in\Nattempting such a seal. You understand, don’t you? The heart to seek out\Nin pursuit of the goal, no matter what obstructive power\Nthere may be… He is the possessor of that quality. He’s an avenger… So you took advantage of that, eh? However, Sasuke is… At some point,\Nhe will definitely seek me out… in search of power. Oh, and, you’re going to kill me…? Why don’t you try? That is, if you can… Kill you as you kill me…?! Am I an idiot…? It seems…it’s over. The winner! Shino Aburame! W-What is he, Neji?! Byakugan! He’s something else…! I can understand him calling bugs\Nwith a Summoning Jutsu… but he harbors bugs all over his body. S-Say what?! He’s of the bug tamer race that\Nis passed down in the Leaf Village. Speaking of which,\NI’ve heard of it… The story of a race that as\Nthey come into this world, possess the secret technique of loaning\Ntheir bodies to bugs as a nest and fight using these bugs. They fully control the bugs and\Nentrust most of the battle to the bugs… I hear that they contract to keep\Ngiving the bugs their own Chakra as food for compensation. So he’s…the successor? That was unfortunate, Zaku. Why’d that happen to Zaku’s arms? Probably, that guy called\NShino or whatever… exploited the opening and\Nstuck those bugs into the exhaust opening in Zaku’s hands. If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave\N in that condition, the energy with no way out\Nwould expand in search of an exit… His arms that are\Ngun barrels blow up… and become useless. Our relationship was only that\Nof having been given the same mission… but... I’ll even the score for you. Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed… What?! What?! So Shino, you were that strong,\Nweren’t you?! Dang it! I thought he was\Na creepy person from long before, but… Oh… S-Shino, good…work… Hey, you did it! Yes… I’m counting on you guys, too. He comes back like he’s\Nthe team leader or something! Dang it! Umm, now then, I would like to\Nget right to the next match. Kakashi Sensei! Yo! Not, “Yo!” Kakashi Sensei! What about Sasuke? Is he okay? Well, he’s fine. He’s sleeping soundly in the infirmary. However, with Anbu Ops\Nstanding as guards… Oh. Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro It’s finally my turn. Kankuro, he’s totally underestimating this… Humph. Idiot… It’s him…! Unlike Yoroi, I don’t get\Ncareless with kids at all. I’ll say this first, once I do my technique… give up no matter what… I’ll bring it to an end swiftly. If so, I’ll also… bring it to an end swiftly! Now then, please begin… the third battle! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry,\Nand you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? I believed in your words the whole time. I wanted to be like you. I thought it would be nice\Nif that happened. So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you. I’m no longer like I was before. There’s no point if I don’t\Nexceed the serious you.

41,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. …bring it to an end swiftly! I won’t let you do anything. First move, a surefire victory! Wow! That’s amazing! What’s with his body?! I dislocate every joint and with Chakra, I can control\Nmy softened body at will. With Chakra…? I can also squeeze until\Nyour bones break. I’ll rapidly tighten as long\Nas you don’t give up. I don’t know what kind of\Nninja tool you’ll use… but if I keep doing this to your body,\Nit will make no difference. I can break your neck right now. So hurry up and give up. No. Do you want to die?! Idiot. You’re the one who’s\Ngoing to die. His neck is broken. What? How ridiculous… Phew… Idiot. I went a little overboard and\Nended up killing you. W-What? Okay, now it’s my turn. T-This is a Puppet! T-That’s the real body? He’s…a Puppet Master… He’s controlling the puppet with\NChakra from his hand! G-Give up…! If your bones get crushed,\Nyou’ll be able to bend even more, huh? For once, I was close to stopping\Nthe match in the middle. The winner, by an inability\Nto continue the match by the opponent, is Kankuro. Two against one is hitting\Nbelow the belt! Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?! It’s not particularly hitting\Nbelow the belt. It’s a puppet, after all. That’s the Puppet Master Jutsu. He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra. It’s the same as using\Na ninja tool-- like shuriken. They’re all great Chakra users… I thought I could make it\Nkind of far with Chakra. Kunoichi Rumble:\NThe Rivals Get Serious! Ino…! You’ve got the jitters,\Ndon’t you, Sakura? Wha…?! Even Sasuke collapsed. I mean, it felt like it was because\Nit was Sasuke that it ended at that. What’ll happen if you take part? It might be best if you quit! Something like that\Nwon’t work on me! It’s okay! I can tough it out\Nthis time around, too. Quit? Who? I can hardly wait. Cha! Bring it on! Now then, to continue,\Nwe will begin the fourth battle. Man, man, nothing but\Nweirdoes all over the place! Don’t you say that! You’ve got a point. You, too, Sakura?! This isn’t the time to be laughing. Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka I never thought…\NI’d be fighting you, Sakura. And what’s more, so soon. Ino was a standout\Namong the rookie Kunoichi. With Sakura as her opponent, will she go…no,\Ncan she go with serious intent? To think it would be those\Ntwo of all people. Things have gotten gloomy. I wonder if Ino’ll be okay. That’s for sure. What’re you going to do, Ino? Sakura! Good luck! Don’t lose! Begin! Oh, no. I knew it. Sakura’s totally blowing Ino away! Idiot. Say what?! If you’re not an idiot,\Nyou must be sleeping, aren’t you? Who…?! Sure enough, they are Kunoichi. So this is their level of\Nhand-to-hand combat? What?! It’s not because they’re Kunoichi. Huh? It’s just that those two are lukewarm.\NThere’s no man or woman in battle. Lukewarm…? There! Kunoichi must learn\Nnot only Ninjutsu… but also a wide range of\Nknowledge and refinement as women. If you don’t blend into enemy territory\Nand conduct yourselves as a normal woman… you’ll have it rough on occasions\Nsuch as when you work as spies. Today’s class is flower arranging. Now then, everyone. Let’s gather flowers we like. Yes, ma’am! Ino, wait up! You’re such a klutz. I’m... not good at stuff like this. What about you, Ino? That’s no good, considering\Nyour name’s Sakura. Listen. There are tricks\Nto things like this. You know, as for flower arranging, after you’ve decided on a main flower,\Nyou add other flowers to decorate. All flowers can’t be\Nasserting themselves. For example…look. You can see those cosmos\Nflowers over there, right…? For example, if they were\Nthe main flowers… the thoroughwort flowers\Nyou picked are throw-ins! As contrasted with\Nspring cherry blossoms, cosmos flowers have the\Nname of autumn cherry blossom and are the prettiest flowers of the fall. Also, they’re flowers with\Nthe original meaning of “harmony,” so any autumn grass would\Ngo perfectly with them. So? Do I look as nice\Nas the cosmos flowers? Say, say, am I cute? Uh…yeah. Say. What’s with the pause? You look like you’re having\Nso much fun. Billboard Brow! You’ve recently reached\Nadolescence, haven’t you? Don’t get too full of yourself! Ami! Sorry! You have such\Na beautiful cylinder-shaped body I mistook you for a vase\Nand put flowers in you. Ino! Shinobi flower aconite. It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,\Nso you’d best spit them out. Sensei! Only the root is poisonous, though. Ino is great. She knows everything,\Nis stylish, and is cute. Even that shuriken skill. Her Ninjutsu is great, too… Compared to that, I… Sakura? If you’re a cosmos flower… then am I a thoroughwort? What’re you saying?! What? Let me see… In a manner of speaking,\Nyou are not a flower, but still a bud! You’re right. At this point in time… I don’t even plan to fight\Nover Sasuke with you. What did you say? You and Sasuke don’t go together,\Nand I’m totally stronger than you! You are beneath my notice! Sakura! Do you know who\Nyou’re lipping off to?! Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura!\N169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like... I feel like Sakura\Nwas out of line! Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.\NShe’s scary. Hmm. That's not it... Huh? Sakura’s not the kind of\Nkid to do things like needlessly flaunt her\Nown power and hurt people. She doesn’t like having Ino\Ntaking pity on her and pulling punches. I’m a bud, huh…? Say, Ino… What? Why…did you give this ribbon to me? Actually… I thought it’d be a waste for\Nyou to wilt away as a bud. There’s no point if flowers don’t bloom. For all we know… it just might... become a flower\Nmore beautiful than a cosmos. Thank you... Ino! Okay Sakura.\NLet’s hurry and go pick flowers. O-Okay. What’s wrong, Sakura? I got some dirt in\Nmy eye when I fell… You’re so clumsy. Ino… All along, I believed in the\Nwords you gave me then. I really thought that it would\Nbe nice if it were so. It would be nice if I could get\Na beautiful flower to bloom… I set my sights on you because\NI wanted to be like you all along. Thanks to that, I’m here now. So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously. If I can’t surpass you at your\Nmost serious, there’s no point. W-What’s with Sakura? Hmm. Why are those two getting that heated?! Alas, he doesn’t even understand\Nthe reason why he lashes out at Sasuke. Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,\Nis the point. Huh? Oh, hi… My rival from youth, Kakashi… Oh, how hip and galling that\Nnonsensical reaction is. I… got on the same team as Sasuke. Why are you telling me now…? I won’t lose to you anymore, Ino. No matter what happens,\NI won’t lose to you either, Sakura! The ribbon… I’m giving back the ribbon. I gave you that ribbon. Besides, a headband is something\Nyou put on your head, right? From here on, I’m no longer\Na girl who will run after you, Ino. When I put this on my head, it will be as a female Shinobi\Nwho can’t lose to you. That’s a good idea… Me, too… until that time. I understand…Sakura. – This time for sure...\N– This time for sure... – with full strength…\N– with full strength… – a fair…fight!\N– a fair…fight! Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry,\Nand you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? Since when did she get this strong?! Sure enough, Ino’s great. But I won’t lose.\NI absolutely will not lose. It can’t be. She’s evenly\Nmatched with me now?! I’m not who I used to be. – The next hit is the decisive blow!\N– The next hit is the decisive blow!

196,"Rock away your existence, Shouting that you are here… A new journey begins now. As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost. When sinking down,\Nwe learned loneliness. But now we’ve met each other,\Nwe are no longer alone. Unveil your feelings,\NThose high emotions Those tears will change your fate. Pound your heartbeat\Nagainst the darkness, We’re sure to meet,\NUnder the same flag of pain So it’s a case of not being able to fight\Nwith the leader unless I defeat the underlings? Well then! Hot-Blooded Confrontation:\NStudent vs. Sensei So you think you’ve blackened the path\Nto this Might Guy’s tomorrow with this? Youth is breaking through\Nthe walls that close you in… If you have both passion and effort,\N then nothing is impossible! With our sights trained on tomorrow…! Is there no tomorrow for us…? So this wood retains\Nits incredible strength because it is reinforced and\Nconnected by Chakra, I see. Guy Sensei… Yagura? Are you all right?! I’m not Yagura… Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,\N Gensho! Second son of the same, Rokkaku! Third son, Jako! Ryudouin? Hmm… I think I’ve heard\Nof that somewhere… Don’t tell me that you don’t remember! Our father, Agira Ryudouin,\Nwas deeply injured by the cowardly strategies of you\NHidden Leaf Shinobi. And unable to execute his missions,\Nhe passed away in despair. Our father resented you to the very end, even muttering your name\Non his deathbed… telling us to fight with\NMight Guy of Hidden Leaf Village. From that day forth, our objective\Nhas been to avenge his death! Yes! We have been lying in wait for\Nthe time when we could get even with you! Oh! Do you mean that Agira?! There’s no way I could forget that battle. Although we were enemies\Non our missions, Agira was a fine man… That will remain in my memory as\Na splendid contest, even within the annals of\Nthe complete eight-volume “Might Guy’s History of Famous Battles.” It was a man-to-man fight. Nothing happened that dishonored\Nmy Way of Ninja! You three must be mistaken. I won’t be angry at you,\Nso let me out of here! Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon\N you to settle my father’s score… I’ll finish you off! Sakura… I noticed you were there some time ago. My master told me to\Nmake sure you don’t overdo it. You’re hiding something, aren’t you?! N-No… Nothing! Sakura, you’re not very good at lying… What? Die, Might Guy!\NEnemy of our father! Wait, I tell you! Hey, you Yagura imposter.\Nlnfiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves, what are you scheming?! Byakugan! Guy is in that building!\NThe building is controlled by their Chakra! Why you--! Intense Brow Sensei,\NI’m coming to your rescue! Wh-What is this?! Do you intend to shut us in\Nwith these pieces of wood? Don’t underestimate us! Stop it, Naruto! Wooden Dummies for training? Are these also controlled by those three? However strong they are, they couldn’t move all of\Nthese Wooden Dummies at once. It’s hard to believe those three would\Nhave that much power. Byakugan! I see. They have a simple mechanism, and their movements are controlled by\Nthe labels stuck to the back of their heads. So, they’re not moved with Puppet Jutsu? No, they’re only designed for\Nrepeated punches and kicks, so they probably cannot respond\Nto our movements! Does this mean their movements\Ncan be halted by removing the labels? So that’s what it’s all about! If that’s the case,\Nthen I’ll return that blow! Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu! Here goes! Once I know the weak spot,\Nyou’re all mine! – Gotcha! 					– Gotcha! Hah! This is easy! These Wooden Dummies are\Njust one small part of our Jutsu! Ninja Art:\NWooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu! Damn you! Keep your wits about you! There’s one that moves differently\N from the others! Neji! U-zu-ma-ki… Naruto Barra--! Stay back! Some of these Wooden Dummies seem\Nto be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu. Be careful! – Lee! 					– Bushy Brow! Leaf Hurricane! Lee?! How did you know we were here?! From what Sakura told us, I felt certain that Guy Sensei\Nwould take this route if he were headed for\Nthe Land of Mountain Streams. And where is Guy Sensei? Inside there. What? A-Are they running away? What’s happening?! It’s just like a castle! Leave this to me! Guy Sensei is my master!\NI would risk my life to save him! But, Bushy Brow,\Nyour leg injury hasn’t healed yet. I’m going in! It’s reckless! Do you intend to interfere? Today, I am just\Na bit different from usual--! Bushy Brow, we’ll cover you. There is a weak point in\Nthe Chakra at the center of the castle. If you hit there, then… But it may be a trap! Everyone… If it is a trap,\N let’s try falling into it intentionally. Over there! Dynamic Entry! As we suspected,\Nit was a trap to lure me in. Anyway, let’s follow it through. Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me. All right. Take revenge on that coward\Nby a suitable method. Leave it to me… Wooden Dummy: Possess:\NTransfer: Repossess Jutsu! A Wooden Dummy here too? Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee… Is that Yagura’s voice I hear? I’ll teach you both,\Nmaster and student, that sometimes passion and\Neffort alone come to naught. I won’t allow you to\Nspeak ill of my teacher. If you’ve got something to say, then why don’t you come out here\Nand say it? There is no need. I can amply prove it with\N the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation. I have come to rescue my teacher! There’s no way\NI’m going to let myself lose to you! You make me laugh… What’s this? The Leaf Hurricane…? Does this mean that the technique\N I deployed that time has been completely imitated\Nand mastered by Yagura?! In that case… Leaf's Severe Hurricane! Can this really be Yagura? If he’s mastered not\Nonly offensive moves, but also learned to guard with\Nsuch perfection then he truly must be a genius! What an incredibly\Npowerful spinning kick… The Gensho I faced off with\Nin the practice hall did not have this much power. To my knowledge, there is only one person who\Ncould let loose this powerful a kick. They are student and teacher\Nwho respect each other. Dying in fighting each other must\N be a wish come true. We’ll have them crush each other with Wooden Dummies mimicking\Neach other’s movements. Even if each were to discover\Nthe true identity of his opponent… They can’t escape from the confrontation without defeating\Nthe Wooden Dummies before their eyes. That is the secret of Wooden Dummy: Possess:\NTransfer: Repossess Jutsu! Looks like my legs\Ncan’t last for very long… If it comes to this,\Nthere’s only one move left. Guy Sensei, it’s okay right? If I use it for your sake,\Nyou’ll probably forgive me. The Lotus? Could it be that the one who is controlling\N this Wooden Dummy is Lee? Dancing Leaf Shadow! A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back\Nto aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes! It’s magnificent…\NToo magnificent! Only Guy Sensei could use\Nsuch artful techniques! Splendid! If I had not been his opponent, I’m 100% certain that he would have\Ntoppled the opponent with that Lotus. But, at this rate,\N I won’t be able to beat this Jutsu… Wait! There is a way. That tapping is Morse Code.\N“You and I are destroying each other…” But there’s no way for either\Nof us to end this fight without defeating the enemy’s Jutsu… So, it was Guy Sensei that\N I was fighting all along? We must both create an attack\N with speed and power of a magnitude that cannot be\N reproduced by the Wooden Dummies… “But I cannot show to you\N the abyss of death again!” Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person\N who is most important to me… “You will forgive me for using\N that move, won’t you? ""To me…"" 					""To me…"" “To me, there is no one more important\Nthan Guy Sensei,” you say? Lee! What do you mean by\Nmaking me cry at a time like this? Lee! I haven’t forgotten the promise\NI made to you back then! “If you die…I shall die with you.” Thank you, Guy Sensei! Now is the very time when… one’s own Way of Ninja… – must be followed to the very end!\N – must be followed to the very end! Third Gate: Gate of Life… Open! Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain… Open! Guy Sensei! We’re far from finished! What’s wrong, Elder Brother? They’re fast. They’re both too fast… At this rate,\Nthe Wooden Dummies will…break. Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing! Open! I can’t see them.\NThey’re faster even than sound! There you go, Lee! Bring the Chakra of your passions\N to bear upon your opponent! Right! – The castle is…\N– …crumbling? If this was revenge, then why did you not come at me\Nwith the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin? That day, though he was\Nthe only man left, your father refused to surrender, but fairly and sportingly confronted me\Nwith Kung Fu. Out of respect to your father,\NI faced him one to one. When the fight was finished,\Nyour father smiled slightly, as if satisfied, and said he would like\Nto fight again… Whether or not you believe me,\Nthis is all there was to it. Could it be that\Nwhat Father wanted to say was not that he wanted us\Nto defeat Master Guy, but that he wanted to fight again,\Nfairly and squarely? Have we had the wrong idea all along? I learned something important from\Nyour father in that fight. It is not the people born with\N natural gifts who are the lucky ones; the truly fortunate are they who,\N believing in themselves to the very end, can go on striving and keep the flame\Nof their passions alive because of it. Uh-huh.\NThat’s a good teacher-student relationship. Naruto! Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get\NBushy Brow to Grandma’s place, will you? Got it! Get him to the stretcher. No, don’t worry about me.\NI’m okay. See to Yagura first. Speaking of which,\NI still haven’t asked of Yagura’s real name. Lee, there’ll be plenty of tim\N for that later. Administering first-aid\Nshould take priority. Yes! Guy Sensei! Yup, yup… That is really one\Nsuper teacher-student relationship. I wish mine was as good… On a checkerboard night when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing I just can’t come out and say,\N“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.” Suggestively Spat at that beloved face!!\NMister Cricket The Trombone gradually going off-key While on the sweaty center stage\Ndoes bug me.

Feudal lords and ceremonies\Nare just a big pain. Tsunade! Yes, yes, I know…\NThis is also the job of the Hokage. – Genma! 					– Here! – Aoba! 					– Here! Issue an official notice and convey this matter to those in the village\Nwithin the next few days. We must introduce the Fifth Hokage. – Yes, ma'am! 					– Yes, ma'am! I hate you, Grandpa! Why did you have to die? The Fifth Hokage… Gimme a break,\Nmy shoulders are so stiff. I wish I could just down\Na nice cup of hot sake and relax. Lady Tsunade! Wait a second! Before you do that, you have something else you need to do,\NOld Lady Tsunade! What was it? I told you, didn’t I?! About Kakashi Sensei and\NSasuke and Bushy Brow! Oh…right, right. Hey, if it isn’t Naruto! Huh? Shikamaru? Why are you in a place like this? That’s my question– Why are you in a place like this? I have no idea why, but my father told me\Nto come along with him. What’s up with that? Long time no see, Lady Tsunade. Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh. Are you taking proper care\Nof the deer? The antlers of the deer from\Nthat area make very good medicine. Yes, I’m somehow managing. Hey, Naruto, who’s that person who acts like such\Na big shot when she's so young? That’s apparently the new Hokage. Huh?! Despite her appearance,\Nshe’s an old lady in her fifties. Yikes! Well, see you again sometime. Yes, ma’am. All right, to the hospital! See you later, Shikamaru. I’m will show you an awesome\Nnew technique I learned! That’s the new Fifth Hokage…? Hey, Shikamaru. That person is the strongest\Nand most beautiful person in the world. Huh? I mean, she’s the lone female\Namongst the Legendary Sannin. Huh… A female Hokage? I’m not very comfortable with women… Huh? Even though they're unusually frank,\Nthey always hang around and you're never quite sure\Nwhose side they're on. They always think they can make\Nmen do whatever they want. Anyway, they’re just a pain. Hey Shikamaru… Without women,\Nmen wouldn’t be born. If women weren’t around,\Nnothing good would come of men. No matter how hard-edged\Na woman might be, she’ll show her gentle side\Nto the man she loves. I can’t believe that Pa’s saying that… when he's tied to Mom’s apron strings. You’ll understand once\Nyou reach that age. Oh no! Let’s hurry up and\Nget our business done… because Mom will chew us out\Nif we’re late. Hurry up, Shikamaru! Looks like nothing will come\Nof some men even if they have a woman. Konoha Hospital I’m coming in. Who are you…? What a beautiful woman… Sakura, Sakura! Everything will be all right now! I brought along an awesome person. Sasuke will be fine now! Naruto… Those two flowers aren’t from\Nthe same day. So this kid is coming here\Nevery day, huh… I heard from Guy Sensei… Please save Sasuke. OK, leave it to me. Sasuke! Sasuke… Sasuke! Sasuke, you…! Hmm, despite his appearance,\Nthat Naruto is pretty considerate. Huh? Next! Next! How disgraceful! To be taken down by\Njust two insurgents. And here I thought you were a genius. I’m sorry… All right! Kakashi Sensei’s done! Next, Bushy Brow! Please hurry up and\Ntake a look at my disciple Lee! Lee! I brought Lady Tsunade here! That’s your disciple? Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple! I see… Naruto. Huh? Is it really okay for you\Nto be idling away your time here like this? Uh, I almost forgot! I had an appointment to\Nmeet Iruka Sensei! Go on! OK! I’ll leave the rest in your hands! All right! Hey, Naruto! You’re late, Iruka Sensei! Sorry, sorry. There were lots of things to do\Nwith respect to the Fifth Hokage. I guess… Thanks for waiting! I’m digging in! Naruto. Huh…? You have really developed compared\Nto the time when you wanted this. I have, haven’t I? You think so too, right? This headband that I received\Nfrom Iruka Sensei suits me perfectly, don’t you think? Stop being so cocky! You still have a long,\Nlong way to go! You have lots of work to do! Listen carefully, Naruto! The Leaf Village is in\Na very difficult situation right now. Starting with the Third Hokage,\Nwe lost many fine Shinobi. The current strength of the Leaf\Nis less than half what it normally is. Despite that, we must continue\Nto carry out our missions. Why is that? If you don’t have enough manpower,\Nyou should turn it down. No, that won’t do… If we turn down our missions, it would be like announcing\Nto other countries our weakened state. Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing\Nwill probably be assigned to missions. I see…these are difficult times. Hey! This concerns you too! You need to play an active role\Nand carry out your duties in order to aid Lady Tsunade. Yeah. But, before I do that,\NI need to satisfy my stomach. That’s just like you. Do your best! Seconds! Hey, hey!\NHow'd you finish so fast?! I'll be straight with you. Give up being a Shinobi. L-Lady Tsunade…\Ndon’t joke like that. There are numerous bone fragments\Nin the area around important nerves. Moreover, they are deeply embedded. You’re not physically capable\Nof carrying out the missions of a Shinobi. Come now, Lady Tsunade,\Ndon’t joke like that… Even if I were to operate… Don’t be fooled, Lee! That Lady Tsunade is an impostor! You changed yourself\Nusing the Transformation Jutsu, you evil woman! Who the heck are you?! Don’t I have any…chance? There is no one besides me\Nwho is capable of doing the surgery and it would take too much time. Furthermore, there is a huge risk… Risk? The probability of\Na successful surgery is 50% at best, and if it fails… You’ll die. Guy Sensei! I’m not at all ready\Nto throw in the towel! Guy Sensei, what’s this god-awful\Nbitter rice dumpling? They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills. If you eat one hundred of them,\Nthey should heal your wound. I see, if I don’t eat\None hundred of them, my wound won’t heal, right? N-Not in a single day! It’s better that you give up being\Na Shinobi and look for a different path. Lee… Lee… If I knew this was going to happen,\NI shouldn’t have brought you to him. Don’t say that…! I am painfully aware of how you feel,\Nbut it’s better to be clear. Because it’s something he’ll have\Nto understand sooner or later. The longer we wait… the harder it will be for him. I believe your promise,\Nits a true heart give me courage Always I feel it\Nthe precious time with you On your still shoulder I feel the wind that blows\Ntowards tomorrow The city lights are like pieces of stars That hold us together “Each one of us glows differently,” you say laughingly but you look most dazzling Like a comet, like the rainbow after the storm You bring light into my heart Being lost can be the answer Let’s promise we won’t cheat Uh... like a shooting star,\Nwe do go ahead.

I’m going to be Hokage! I won’t lose here! Whatever! You can’t keep up\Nwith my speed at all! U-! Zu-! Ma-! Ki-! Naruto Barrage! The winner is Naruto Uzumaki. I’m…getting stronger! Ohhhh! Cha! Nice one! You did it! T-That Naruto beat Kiba! It’s a major upset… Yup! Yes! Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold! This medicine works really well! Here! Do you want to\Nuse it too, Sakura? Only your wounds heal\Nwith such speed…Naruto. The power of Nine Tail never\Ncease to amaze me. U-Umm... T-This is… ointment for your wound, for you Kiba and Akamaru. Rather than worrying about others, it’s about time you worried\Nabout yourself! Kiba… There are only 6 people left… you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,\Nand the Sand guy. Listen, Hinata… If you pull that guy from Sand,\Nwithdraw quickly. And there’s one more… Do the same if you get Neji, too. Withdraw quickly… That guy will be hard on you. He will destroy you. Well, let’s announce the next match. – Huh? 					– Huh? – What? 					– Huh? Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga Hinata… This is going to be an interesting match… I never thought that I would\Nhave a fight with you… Lady Hinata. Brother Neji… Brother? Huh?! Those two are siblings? They’re descended from one of the most honorable\Nold families in the Hidden Leaf… The Hyuga Clan. But, they’re not siblings. Then, how are they related? Well, the relation of a head family\Nand branch family… That may be an appropriate\Nway to say it. Head family and branch family? Yes! Hinata is from the head family. In other words, a person from\Nthe main household and Neji is from a branch family\Nthat is descended from that family. In other words,\Nit’s a fight between relatives. It must be uneasy for both of them… Yes. However… Huh? What is it? I’ve heard that from long ago, there’ve been various incidents between\Nthe head family and branch family, and now their relationship\Nisn’t on very good terms. Hmmm. Why? I don’t know the details either. Only… The so-called distinguished Ninja clans\Nlike Uchiha and Hyuga have special techniques and\Nabilities that run in the family. It seems that the Hyuga household\Nlaid down rules for communicating those techniques… It seems that there are many rules\Nthat favor the head family… – Huh? 					– Huh? And there have been\Nvarious incidents between the head family and\Nbranch family due to those rules. So this is a confrontation billed\Nas a clash of fate… Oh, it’s gonna begin. Start the battle please! Just one thing before we square off\Nagainst each other in the fight… I should advise you, Lady Hinata. Withdraw! You’re not suited to being a Shinobi. You’re too nice. You wish for harmony and\Navoid conflict, you’re open to going with\Nthe thinking of others. And, you have no confidence\Nin yourself. You’re always feeling inferior… You thought it’s a good idea\Nto stay Genin. However, you can’t register for\Nthe Chunin test without three members… So you couldn’t turn down when Kiba\Nand the other proposed it and, the truth is, you entered\Nthe exam reluctantly. Is that wrong?! T-That’s wrong… That’s not true… I… I only… I wanted to change that about myself… So I proposed it myself… Hinata… Stand up, Hanabi! From now on, I’ll keep Hinata\Nunder my wing… But is that really okay? Hinata should be the heir to\Nthe Hyuga clan… But, there is always death involved\Nwith the job of Genin. Do what you want. She’s a failure who’s inferior even to her\Nyounger sister Hanabi, five years her junior. We don’t need her here\Nin Hyuga clan… Is that all you have to say? If so, leave! You’re in the way! Yes. Hinata is trying to change\Nherself in her own way. Lady Hinata… You are a spoiled one of\Nthe head family. People can never change! A failure will always be a failure… That personality and strength\Nwon’t change. That guy… Since people don’t change,\Ndifferences exist among them… and expressions like “elite”\Nand “failure” are born. Everyone judges and are judged based on the value of their face and\Nbrain, ability and body type, good and bad points of\Ntheir personalities. People have to suffer and live within the means of the\Nelements they cannot change. Just like the fact that I’m from a\Nbranch family and you’re from the head family, these things can’t change. I’ve seen everything with\Nthis Byakugan. That’s why I understand! You’re just talking tough. You’re really thinking that you’d\Nlike to run away from this place… T-That’s wrong… I really… Byakugan? It’s said that if you trace\Nthe Uchiha Clan’s history, the clan’s ability has its source\Nin Hyuga clan. The Byakugan is one of the\NHyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai, a Visual Jutsu similar\Nto Sharingan… However, with the ability of insight alone… it gets the better of Sharingan. Byakugan! Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga My eyes can’t be deceived. Just now from my pressure, your line of sight was pushed\Nto the upper left. This is the sign that you're recalling\Nyour past experience… your bitter past. And soon after that, your line of sight\Nmoved to the bottom right… This is the sign that you're imagining\Nphysical and mental suffering. That means… you’re picturing your old self, and from all of your experiences\Nup until now, you’re imagining the result\Nof this battle… The image of you losing! Even the act of propping your arms\Nin front of your body… It’s a gesture that means you want to build a wall\Nbetween us and keep distant. And that reflects your mind... that you don’t want any more\Nof your deepest feelings to be raided… Because everything I’ve said\Nis right on the mark, right? Furthermore… Laying a finger on your lips, that too, is a self-familiarizing act\Nwhich represents a sense of panic. It represents a defense instinct-- you want to alleviate the tension\Nand unease. In other words… deep in your heart,\Nyou know it’s true, don’t you? Changing yourself,\Nis something you absolutely can’t--! Sure, she can! You don’t have the privilege of\Ndeciding what a person is like, stupid! Give it to him, Hinata! Naruto… Hinata! Don’t just take it!\NArgue back! I’m getting irritated watching this! Naruto… What an annoying guy! Naruto… Thank you! The expression of her eyes\Nhas changed… So you’re not going to withdraw? I ‘m not taking responsibility\Nfor what happens! I… I won’t run away! I don’t… I don’t change my words… That’s my Way of Ninja! ...want to run anymore! Byakugan! Brother Neji! I challenge you! T-That is… Fine… Of course, the same Hyuga style… Her pose is very similar\Nto Neji’s. Hyuga style? The strongest Taijutsu style\Nin the Village Hidden in the Leaf… Huh? I said it before... The man who is most likely the strongest Genin of Hidden\NLeaf Village is on my team… That’s… That guy, Neji Hyuga. Here! Did it go in?! No…it was shallow! No. Even a graze works. That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan is called the Hidden Leaf’s\Ndistinguished family. Huh? What do you mean? The Hyuga has a particular\NTaijutsu passed down through generations. It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu that\NLee and I are good at… Our way of fighting, Furious Fist, is mainly to inflict external damage\Non our enemy, like broken bones and surface wounds. In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsu\Ninflict damage on the Chakra Network through\Nwhich Chakra flow through the body, and damaging the insides,\Nnamely, it destroys internal organs. They possess the Gentle Fist. It’s not spectacular to watch… but later it slowly takes effect. Well, you can’t train the internal organs… Even if you were really robust, one hit from it would be\Na deadly blow… Even I can… Hinata’s on the offensive… Hinata… Way to go, Hinata! To attack the Chakra Network… What are they, those people…? Hey! Hey! Chakra Network, what’s that?! Here we go again… a question from a stupid guy. I’ll explain. They’re like blood canals. In the same way that blood flows\Nthrough vessels throughout the body, They’re bundles of canals that take\NChakra’s into every corner of your body… Oh! Like a path for Chakras, huh? Yes… Furthermore, the Chakra Network\Nis closely connected with the internal organs which\Nenfold Chakra within the body. That’s why if\Nthe Chakra Network is attacked the internal organs also suffer damage. Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya? Hey you!\NThat's no way to talk to your senior! It’s no wonder… Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy. That’s… him. Sensei… But, how can they do that? After all, the Chakra Network\Nisn’t visible to the eyes. How do they attack the Chakra\Nline inside the body? No. The eyes of those two… They can see it with\Ntheir Byakugan. And a Gentle Fist attack is a little\Ndifferent from a regular attack. They release their own Chakra from a Chakra opening in their hand\Nand screw it into their opponent’s body. It directly inflicts damage on\Nyour enemy’s Chakra Network. All right! Has she done it? Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry,\Nand you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? Amazing! That Hinata! She’s always melancholy\Nand wishy-washy and… I thought she is kinda weird, yet… Even when she gets blow after blow,\Nshe gets back up and goes. There’s something about\Nher way of fighting. Just a feeling,\Nbut she resembles you, I think. Resembles me?\NHinata resembles me? Now that I think about it, that girl,\Nshe was always watching you. Huh?

Sasuke…? No… Who is he? He's got the same Sharingan\Nas Sasuke. Really… who’d believe a kid like you to\Nhave the Nine-Tailed Fox in him. Why does that guy know\Nabout the Nine-Tailed Fox?! Naruto, you will come with us. Roar, Chidori!\NBrother vs. Brother! That guy is…close by! That guy! Elder Brother… Today… when school’s over,\Nhelp me train for a Shuriken Jutsu… I’m busy… Have father teach you. But you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu,\NElder Brother… Even I can see that. You always treat me\Nlike a pest, Elder Brother. Ouch! Forgive me Sasuke…\NSome other time, okay? I don’t have time to\Npay attention to you today. You’re always jabbing my forehead\Nand saying ""Forgive me, Sasuke."" You also say ""not today,""\Nbut there's never a day. Father. Huh? Why doesn’t Elder Brother\Npay any attention to me? That guy’s a little strange… He’s the type that doesn’t really like\Nto become intimate with people. Why? I don’t know. I am his father and\Nstill I can’t read that boy… Here! Your boxed lunch, Sasuke! If you’re worried about doing\NShuriken Jutsu practice, I will watch you when you get home. They’re not practices,\Nthey’re training! See you later! Sasuke, are you on\Nyour way to school? Yes. I saw Itachi earlier on.\NHe’s really become a man. He’s already a top-notch Shinobi. He graduated at the head of his class\Nat the Academy at the age of seven, and attained Chunin level\Nat the age of ten, didn’t he? He became adept at using\NSharingan at the age of eight. Yes, I remember. That boy is truly\Nthe pride of the Uchiha clan. By the way,\Nhow old are you now, Sasuke? I’m the same age as\Nwhen Elder Brother graduated, but I can’t… What’s the matter? Hey! Stop talking nonsense! Oh my, dear. Sasuke, both you and Itachi\Ncome from the same Uchiha clan, the pedigree of\Nthe Hidden Leaf Village. Have confidence! You’ll be an amazing\NShinobi just like Itachi one day. Yeah! See you later! Do your best! Study hard! That’s right… I come from the same Uchiha clan\Nas Elder Brother… I won’t lose to Elder Brother! I’m pretty late… What was that? I had the feeling\Nthere was someone there… The lights are out.\NEven though it’s not time for bed… What’s this?! W-What’s this?! What in the world is this?!

To measure my abilities… Measure your abilities…?\NJust for that? Are you saying that… Just for that…\Nyou killed them all? That is of great importance. What do you mean…? Don’t talk rubbish! I’m scared… I’m scared! Don’t kill me…! D-Don’t kill me! You are not even worth killing… Foolish little brother… If you want to kill me, begrudge me!\NHate me! And keep on surviving in\Nthat unsightly manner… Just continue fleeing and fleeing\Nand hang onto your life! Shall we go outside…? These guys aren’t just anybody… Itachi, it’ll be a pain in the neck\Nif this kid moves around and… Maybe I better chop off\Na leg just in case… W-What did he say?! Now then… Long time no see… Sasuke. Itachi Uchiha! Itachi…Uchiha? The same as Sasuke…\NAn Uchiha… Huh…Sharingan… And moreover,\Nhe resembles you a lot… Who the heck is he? He’s my younger brother. But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan\Nhad been murdered. By you. Itachi Uchiha…I will kill you! I must kill one certain man\Nwithout fail! That man… My elder brother… I thought I couldn’t die…\Nwithout killing him, but… That’s the guy that Sasuke\Nwas saying … The man he wanted to kill… It’s just as you said… I held a grudge against you\Nand hated you. For the singular purpose of\Nkilling you, I… I… have lived my life! Sasuke…! Chidori…? I will kill you! Die! W-What’s going on?! I can’t believe that Sasuke’s Jutsu\Nwas so easily thwarted… This doesn’t look good! I’ve got to do something! Chakra permeates the air… I see… So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra! You jerk! You’re in the way! Sasuke! Darn it! Ninja Art: Summo… You’re too slow! Huh…? I can’t feel the Chakra… Darn! Darn! Why is it?! My sword Shark Skin\Nhas the ability to… cut through and eat Chakra! It’s a pain in the butt if the kid moves around\Nand uses Jutsu like that… Before these legs… Should I chop off these arms? Why doesn’t it emerge?! It’s pointless… What? You guys just don’t know me much,\Ndo you? This man Jiraiya does not fall victim\Nto any woman’s allurement, but rather his forte is\Nwinning women’s affection! I’m not made to blindly follow after\Na woman’s feminine charm! When you get to my level, women yelp with delight\Nat my sex appeal! A cycle of hardship, right? Inside, we were crying, right? But the one thing we won't give up\Nis the dream we've chosen, right?

With that Puppet Master Jutsu\Nwhere you have to concentrate on the control of the puppet… the one casting the Jutsu is\Nprone to openings in defense. You’re very aware of the weakness\Nof a puppet master! However, from here on, I’ll show you the essence of\Nthis Ninjutsu fighting style! The real terror of Crow…\Nmy puppet of warfare! This is Poison Smoke Bomb! Did I inhale…a little bit? I get it…\NAnd the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh? Listen, everyone… Even if enemy Shinobi appear,\Ndon’t panic. Go into the hidden room quickly.

Easy to say… It’s not that I’m holding a grudge… But on account of you,\NI had kind of a tough time of it. I see… But…why you…? I owe a lot… to the Leaf. Sasuke! I heard that we’d made up\Nwith the Sand traitors… But to think you’d change\Nthis abruptly… It’s not like we attacked the Leaf\Nfor the fun of it… It was an order… In the same way\Nthat I’m here now. I see. The Fifth Hokage\Nasked the Sand… It’s a big help. By the way…\Nhas your sharpness gotten worse? Huh? Are you going to give up again\Nor something? This time, I’ll do it for you! Sorry, but I can’t give up. A man mustn’t be protected\Nby a woman, so… As usual, you’re a guy who’s annoying\Nwith the man-and-woman stuff. Even if you act tough, it’s totally obvious\Nthat it’s bravado, you idiot! This time you’re taking sides\Nwith the Leaf, huh?! You guys sure are busy\Nall over the place! She uses Genjutsu\Nwith the sound of her flute. Right! Cyclone Scythe Jutsu! Blowing away the sounds of the flute and being able to nail the opponent\Nwith a physical attack. To think she can attack and defend\Nwith one hand… Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu. That woman’s a natural enemy to me! Has Ukon…just about caught him\Naccording to the strategy? Puppet, huh…? You three had been approaching\Ntogether, right? Two went on ahead. You guys are weak, so… You idiot… These guys are\Nout of the ordinary! Behind you! I can’t…move. What’s this guy? I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it! Where’s the other one? Hey! Who are you looking for? That state… I know! Be careful!\NThey enter the body and start to fuse! It’s too late. This guy! What’s the matter, Sakon?! It seems like… your Jutsu didn’t work…\Non the puppet. This is a puppet, too?! Let me tell you this. We, the Sand Ninja,\Naren’t as lax as the Leaf. Moreover, don’t be carelessly\Napproaching… the Black Ant! He was fearsome\Nwhen he was an enemy... But to think he’d be this dependable\Nwhen becoming an ally. Ow… I got careless.\NLet me rest in your body for a bit. Good-for-nothing guy… Who are these guys? This is their ability! Although you were caught off guard… you getting hammered\Nby that puppet play… Well… Its power and speed\Nare nothing special. I won’t be beaten\Nby the likes of such a toy. And I was able\Nto heal my belly wound. I don’t have much Chakra left…\Nbut well, these are opponents I should be able\Nto tear apart, nevertheless. Indeed, it seems he’s healed.\NWhat a recovery ability he’s got. Ordinarily, I’m not the one\Nwho becomes the main body, so it’s hard to move, damn it. You sure are mocking us… He’s not an opponent\Nyou can beat fighting head on! We should retreat for now and… We can’t back down after having been\Nmocked, you know. Don’t mess with me! The Black Ant isn’t a Mechanism\Nfor attacking. Primarily, it’s just for capturing. And…Crow paired up with the Black Ant\Nis exclusively for attacking. Hey you! Let me out! Eat this! Puppet Show… Hey, let me out! Let me out! Secret Black Move Iron Maiden! The play is over. She hid, huh…? Or did she run away? No…That couldn’t be… I just got here. Briefly explain the present situation including an analysis of her ability\Nand battle style. First off, her fundamental tactic is\Nensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu with the sound of her flute. And then she delivers physical attacks\Nto that opening. Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia! This is bad! Is this Genjutsu? I can’t move my body…! I believe this was your last hand, right? Unfortunately…\Nthis is reversed checkmate! You little rat! She’s a classic Genjutsu-style\Ndistance range type. Most likely, she must’ve seen your Jutsu\Nand figured out immediately that it wouldn’t mix well\Nwith her own Jutsu. And it’s two against one, too. She’ll never appear before us again\Nuntil she casts her Genjutsu. Sound, huh…? Yeah… Genjutsu generally appeal\Nto the five senses of people… sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. The type that uses hearing\Nis the most troublesome of them all. After she cleverly takes a distance on you\Nand then hides… you have no idea where the Genjutsu\Nwill be cast from or when. The idea is for us to already be cast\Nby the Genjutsu by the time we’ve figured out where she is\Nby the sound of the flute… Ouch… In my opinion, we’re at an\Noverwhelming disadvantage. A battle with this type, essentially,\Nwouldn’t even be worth talking about without sensor types\Nlike Kiba or Neji. At this rate, we’ll get pushed into a corner\Nsooner or later. – We should just retreat…\N– Who asked for your opinion?! I told you to just explain the situation. Don’t misjudge my power… If she thinks\Nshe’s hiding well from me… in a distance enough for the sound\Nof her flute to reach… she’s naïve! Summoning: Blade Dance Cut! All right… I’ve made it this far.\Nlt’s about time for my Genjutsu… Huh? How about it? It’s done. She’s sure…pushy. She’s scarier than my mom. Pretty good, huh? But well… I just have to be grateful\Nfor this time…huh? For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words Would you think it was\Na bother if I approached you? Despite my doubts,\NI worked up my courage My clumsy attempts with words You listened without turning away No wonder I get carried away by you But you don’t feel anything for me, do you? I feel so sad But… For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you I got careless earlier,\Nbut it won’t be like that now! Now, you please stand back. I’m grateful for the help,\Nbut his opponent will be me! Next, for sure,\Nwith my ultimate Lotus…! Hey, why are you moving forward?\NI’m his opponent!

Who’s talking here?!\NYou're as stupid as he is! B-But… I made it to the final round\Nof the Chunin Exam! You were in the final round\Nof the Chunin Exam?! Yeah, that’ s right! If I weren’t interrupted\Nin the middle of it, I could have won the tournament\Nand become a Chunin! Hah! Then you must have had\Na darn easy proctor. Really, the level of\Nthe Chunin Exam has dropped… Oh! Idate, so you are… I remember now! Idate Morino. Morino… That’s right! Wasn’t the proctor\Nof the first test….? Be quiet, you rotten runts! Sorry to have kept you waiting. I’m the proctor for\Nthe first test of the Chunin Exam. My name is Morino Ibiki. Morino… Ibiki… What did you say? Brother I-Ibiki is alive?! Yes… Of course, he’s alive! He gave me a weird problem\Non the 10th question… Is that true?\NHe really is alive?! Wh-What’s this?! An ambush! How is it? As you can see,\Nit’s right in front of us. Then, let’s get started\Non our plan! Darn! Naruto and I will chase them away! Sakura, take care of Idate! Isn’t it better to run…? Too late for that! I’ll cover you. Remove the ropes! Gotcha! Darn! I have to cut these! Darn it! I lost them all that time! Hey, lend me that thing! What?! Just hand it to me, hurry! Bastard, this is more important\Nthan my life. There’s no way\NI’ll let you use it… This is no time to be saying\Nstuff like that! S-Stop you idiot! Hurry up, you loser! Heh, piece of cake! Sakura! They are just clones! Only the real one can attack you,\Nso don’t worry! Sharingan! Sakura, Naruto! The real ones are hiding among\Nthe clones! Be careful! Sasuke! Guide us! Idate, stay close to me! Hah! I don’t want a Ninja’s help! Are you still saying that\Nin this situation?! Naruto! Behind you! Naruto! A clone?! Oh, shoot! – Clone for clone!\N– Clone for clone! Damn, they got away. Nice work! Naruto! That Shadow Clone kid\Nis troublesome. The next plan, Kagari! We’ll kill them all! Water Style!\NBlack Rain Jutsu! Sasuke! They’ve changed\Ninto Water Clones! I know! Rain? No! This is oil! How annoying!\NI’ll get rid of them all at once! That’s Tiger Seal! Sasuke, no! Oops… Unlucky… Humph, not really. Fire attack?! B-Brother… Go! Having you stay will be\Na burden to me! B-Brother… Idate? N-Nothing! Sasuke, what can we do?! If the fire is this strong… We’ll have to dive in\Nto the ocean! From here, we can swim\Nto the port of Nagi Island! Right! There’s no other option left. Idate, can you swim? Y-Yeah… Hurry! I’ll cover you, so go first! This smoke should help you\Nescape unnoticed! Idate?! There’s no way! Wha--? You are tricking me into\Nbecoming a decoy! What are you talking about?! You’re trying to get\Nthe enemy’s attention to me! That’s nonsense! No! I don’t trust Ninja! What are you doing? Go! Having you stay will be\Na burden to us! Go! Having you stay\Nis a burden! Hurry up and go! There’s no way we will\Nuse you as a decoy! N-No… Cha! Idate! Duck down!

The most enjoyable part\Nis still left undone. Darn, they are\Nunexpectedly tenacious. Yeah. But we won’t\Nlet them get away. I-I should be okay here… Long time no see, Idate.

21,"C'mon! Running like a fugitive, Being chased by something Inside my heart is pounding My throat dry like it's withering For no single one, To none does belong, This time is ours, right now... Unraveling the pain, Unraveling our hearts, Unraveling shadows Stifling our breath, Reaching for beyond, Tearing through the dark In fighting and in love To the distant light above, Yes, we are on the way I wanna rock... Rockin' my heart You're an embarrassment\Nto our village. Why do you think we came all\Nthe way here to Leaf Village? P-Please listen to me, Gaara. T-They lashed out first… Shut up! I'll kill you. U-Understood, I was wrong. I-I'm sorry…\NI'm really sorry. I'm sorry about that… This guy…has a nasty look. To think he was able to hit\Nthat Kankuro with a tiny rock with great ease. This guy's…good. Let's go. We didn't come here\Nto play around. I know. Hold it! What is it? Judging from your headbands, you're Ninjas from the Village\NHidden in the Sand, right? Without question, the Land of Fire and\Nthe Land of Wind are allied nations. But the arbitrary coming and\Ngoing of Shinobi is supposed to\Nbe prohibited by the treaty. State your purpose! Depending on circumstances… Hmph! So this is what they mean by the darkest place being\Nunder the candlestick. Don't you know anything about it? My permit! As you say, we're Sand Village Genins\Nfrom the Land of Wind. We came to this village to\Ntake the Chunin Exam. Chunin Exam…? Identify Yourself:\NPowerful New Rivals What is the Chunin Exam anyways? You really don't know\Nanything, do you? Bro, if you pass the exam,\Nyou can become a Chunin from a Genin! I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them! Heh! Hey! You there… What's your name? Huh?  M-Me? No! The gourd next to you! I'm Gaara of the desert… I have an interest in you as well… What's your name? Sasuke Uchiha. Say! Say! What about me?\NWhat about me? Not interested. Heh! Things have gotten interesting. Konohamaru, do I look weak? Compared to Sasuke, yes... Sasuke, I won't lose to you! What's gotten into you,\Nall of a sudden?! What do you think? I don't think they're anything special. But the black-haired one from Leaf Village\Nand the gourd from the Sand Village… those two need to be checked. Now then, in conjunction\Nwith beginning the Chunin Exam, let us first have those in charge\Nof the rookie Genin come forward. Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma… So?  Are there any Genin from\Nyour squads you wish to recommend\Nfor these exams? It goes without saying, but if it's a Genin who has carried out\Neight or more formal missions, you can recommend them\Nfor the exams if you wish. Well, as a general rule, having carried out more than twice\Nthat amount of missions is appropriate. There's no need to hear this… It's too soon for them. Then, you first Kakashi. The Kakashi-led Group Seven... Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.\NSakura Haruno. I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these\Nthree for the Chunin Exam. Huh? The Kurenai-led Group Eight... Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,\NShino Aburame. These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,\Nrecommend the same. The Asuma-led Group Ten... Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,\NChoji Akimichi. These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,\Nrecommend the same. All three recommended… To think rookies will be\Nin the Chunin Exam… Hasn't it been five years\Nsince that's happened? Hmm… Wait a minute! What is it, Iruka? Lord Hokage, please let me\Nsay one thing. This may be presumptuous, but as for the nine names\Nthat were given, I was in charge of them at the Academy. Admittedly, they were all students\Nwith ability, but it's too soon…! They should be tested after\Nhaving gained more experience! I became a Chunin when I was\Nsix years younger than Naruto is now. Naruto is different from you! Is it your intent to crush Naruto?! They always do nothing but complain\Nabout important missions… Teaching them a lesson\Nonce would be fun. Trying to crush them\Nwould be interesting, too. W-What did you say?! Well, joking aside… Iruka Sensei... I understand what you want to say. It's aggravating, I know.\NHowever… Kakashi... Don't do it. Stay out of this!\NThey're not your students anymore! Now they're my subordinates! Man…troublesome people. B-But the Chunin Exam\Nis also known as… Iruka… I understand your point. Master Hokage... Therefore, I have decided to conduct a special preliminary exam\Nfor these rookie Genins. P-Preliminary exam…?! Say! Say! Say! Why is it that he's the one who\Nalways calls us out, and then makes us wait?! That's right! That's right! What's he going to do about\Nthe feelings of a maiden who accidentally overslept and resigned\Nherself to no blow-drying?! I overslept, so I haven't washed my face\Nand didn't brush my teeth. Y-You…That's dirty. Why're these guys so hyper\Nfirst thing in the morning?! Hey, good morning, folks! Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life… Right! That's a lie!! Uh, well… This is sudden, but I recommended\Nyou guys for the Chunin Exam, so… Here, these are your applications. Chunin Exam… That being said, the recommendations\Nare not compulsory. You guys are free to decide whether\Nyou take the Exam or not. All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei! Hey, cut it out. Get away already… Only those who want to take the Exam,\Nsign that application and come to Room 301 of the Academy\Nat 3:00 p.m. five days from now… That's it! Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam! Chunin Exams, eh… I bet lots of strong guys would be there… For example, that guy! And this guy! Okaaay! I won't lose to\Nanybody no matter what! If I take the first place, the path to\Nthe Hokage is right there! Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto\Nwill be the Hokage… I'll just retire my elderly self at once. Yaaaay! I might be able to fight him. I...don't want to… Here I can't… keep up with Sasuke,\Nand not even with Naruto… The Chunin Exam, no way… Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play! Sure. I don't have any missions today,\Nso I'll play with you guys! Yaaay! Oh! Leader! Konohamaru! What're you going to do with Moegi?! Hey, you! Let Moegi go! Darn!\NLet's follow them, Konohamaru! Y-Yeah! W-Wait! Chunin Exams, eh… Yo. S-Sasuke, what's up? How about we go for a little walk? No way! For real?! Well well... So you can keep up\Nat this speed, eh? Wait for me! Moegi! Bro, where'd you go? I think we are lost. Nooo! Let me go! Even the strongly fortified\NVillage Hidden in the Leaf… is mine if I slip in the\Nmiddle of Chunin Exam's ruckus. Hmm? That was fast… Hey! You fat old man! What're you going to do with Moegi? What am I going to do, you ask? You want to know? Wha--?! Don't move! If you do,\Nthe brat's dead meat! Y-You. Why're you doing this?! I want the first Hokage's\NScroll of Sealing! If you bring it to me,\NI'll return the brat! Scroll of Sealing… Umm… Sasuke… What's up, all of a sudden? Sakura… Give up on the Chunin Exam…\Nlt's too early for you. Is it…? I thought so… The Chunin Exam is\Na gathering of top dogs… You might die if you're not careful… Sasuke… So you're worried about me, right? Yeah…kind of… What a display of affection, eh? Get lost! If you don't want to die. Don't talk as if you know everything! Don't make me angry! Sasuke! Don't take me lightly! Sasuke! Sasuke? Sasuke! Sasuke!! What're you doing? Hurry up and bring me\Nthe Scroll of Sealing! What'll happen…if I say, heck no? You don't care what happens\Nto this brat? Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens\Nto that bunch of straw, I say. Wha--?!\NWhen did he do that?! I've taken Moegi back from you,\Nthank you! As expected great leader!\NMoegi respects you. Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh…? You don't know when to give up! Naruto! Hey! You're late, Konohamaru! Konohamaru, I was scared. Oh, there-there… Leader, did you catch him? Yup, as you can see! Huh?  What?! Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu! Dang it! When did he switch?! I see… If you don't want to turn out\Nlike this, you'll give up on\Nthe Chunin Exam, too. Sasuke, don't die…! Big mistake if you think\NI'd say that. I was aware of this Genjutsu\Nright from the start! What?! The real Sasuke wouldn't do\Nsomething like invite me to go for a walk! Don't make me say\Nsuch frustrating things! That kind of elementary Genjutsu\Nwon't work on me! Did you say elementary…? That's right! Incidentally, I've seen through that\Nyou're also an illusion and aren't really here! I don't know about… that! See? Just what I'd expect of\NKakashi's subordinate. However, this will become reality\Nin the Chunin Exam! I wonder if you can endure that…? I'm not scared!\NI'll take them on anytime! The Chunin Exam isn't...\NThe Chunin Exam isn't…! I'm still not sure if I can do it… That was a stupid thing to do… How was it? We went to the trouble of having\Na special preliminary exam, but all nine of the rookies passed. As you say, it appears their skills\Nhave definitely improved. Well, the actual Chunin Exam\Nwon't just end at this, but... Hey, have you heard? Rookies are going to be\Nin the Chunin Exam for the first time in five years. No way. It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills\Nor something anyway. No… The story is that three among them\Nare that Kakashi's unit. That's interesting… Well, be that as it may… That's a sad story… Sakura, you're late! Yeah…sorry… Morning, Sasuke. Yeah… Something's strange about Sakura. So, are you sure you're going\Nto attempt taking the Chunin Exam with that skill? May it'd be best if you runts quit. You're green-assed brats, after all. Please let us through. That's…mean… What did you say?! Listen!\NWe're being nice to you! The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle. Many times have we seen\Npeople quit Shinobi as well as people who were\Ndisabled for life just because they took this Exam. Also, a Chunin is at the level\Nof a unit leader. Mission failures,\Ndeath of subordinates, it's all part of the\Nresponsibilities of a leader! A brat such as this a Chunin? What's so bad about weeding out\Nthose who won't pass anyway?! A just argument. However, you will let me through. And could you also immediately\Nundo this barrier created with Genjutsu? I have business on the third floor. What's this guy talking about…? I don't know… – Well, well…\N– So you noticed, eh? How about it, Sakura? You should've been\Nthe first one to realize it. Huh…? Your analytical strength and\NGenjutsu know-how has improved the most in our squad, so... Sasuke… Thank you… Of course. I realized it ages ago! You see, this is the second floor! Yup! Well, not bad…\NBut all you've done is to catch on. Right?! H-He's fast! This person… He's a different person from\Nwhen he was getting punched before! He stopped my kick… What's with that Chakra in his arm? Hey, this isn't what you promised. You were the one who said you didn't want to carelessly\Nattract attention and be watched. But… Oh boy… 					This again… This guy… The marks where he was hit\Nare disappearing. Was he faking? My name's Rock Lee.\NYour name's Sakura, right…? Huh? Please go out with me!\NI'll protect you until I die! Absolutely…not. Huh? You're... too intense. Hey, you there. Identify yourself. Dang it! Again? It's always about Sasuke! When asking someone his name,\Ngive your own name first. You're... a rookie, right?\NHow old are you? I'm not obliged to answer. What…? Cute. Too intense, huh… Uninterested, huh… Now then!\NSasuke, Naruto, let's go! So those are Kakashi and\NGuy's treasured brats. Well, for the time being,\Ntheir applications will pass. Yeah… It appears this year's test-takers\Nwill be amusing… For us proctors too, eh. Good grief… This Chunin Exam…\Nis full of monsters. Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes\Nand bushy eyebrows. Oh! It's you! You're the overly intense guy\Nwho just got rejected by Sakura. What's with your bizarre\Ngreen jumpsuit? What? You want to challenge me,\Nbushy-browed bumpkin? I'll teach you that it's a million years\Ntoo soon to be doing that. Next episode:\N ""Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!""

38,"Press down hard on the gas That’s right, there’s no compromise We'll slip through the night At the final moment push hard That's right, all the way to zero, Until we wipe away the days Gently open your heart If you pull it close to you It will reach you, without a doubt It will come, closer Now We’re speeding through life,\Nsqueezing it for all of its worth Our feet are tied But we still keep going farther Even if I take it back, and grasp it If you’re not the one There will be no meaning And so we’ll go far off into the distance. It’s a custom where balance is preserved\Nby fighting and removing life. This is the friendship\Nof the Shinobi world. This is a fight for life with the pride\Nof the village and one’s own dream on the line. Heh, I’m convinced. Anything is fine. Just tell us the content\Nof that fight-for-life test. Very well. Now then, this is where I’d\Nlike to explain the third exam. But actually… Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was\Ngiven the task of judge, to speak first. I leave it to you… There’s something... I’d like you all\Nto do... before the third exam. And that is a preliminary\Nto the third exam, with participation in\Nthe main battle on the line. Preliminary? What do you mean…preliminary?! Sensei, I don’t understand\Nthe point of that preliminary. Why aren’t we doing the next exam\Nwith the remaining test-takers? This time around, perhaps because the first and\Nsecond exams were easy, there are a few too many\Npeople left, you see. In accordance with the rules\Nof the Chunin Exams, a preliminary will be held in order to\Nreduce the number advancing. N-No way! As Lord Hokage said before, many guests will be coming\N to the third exam. So we can’t have long pointless matches\Nand our time is limited as well. Therefore, those of you\Nnot in top physical condition… Hey, is he okay…?! The teacher doesn’t look well himself?! Excuse me. Those of you who wish to drop out,\Nplease speak up now. The preliminary will\Nbegin immediately, so… Immediately, you say…?! But we finally made it through\N the second exam. This is a pain… Huh? What about our meal? Narrowing the Field:\NSudden Death Elimination! Okay! I’m going to do my best, no matter what! I promised Kabuto, too… And oh... I forgot to mention this, but it will\Nbe individual battles from now on. It is your decision, so feel free\Nto raise your hands and drop out. Who’s going to quit?! Sasuke?! The waves of pain are\Ncoming faster... Sasuke… I knew it. Sasuke, you should quit\Nthese preliminaries! Huh?! L-Look, you haven't been yourself ever since you got worked\Nover by that Orochimaru guy! That bruise hurts even now, right…? Bruise…? At this rate…! I gave him a parting gift. Sasuke will definitely seek me…\Nin search of power. You’re the only one left. Please… Please, quit! I’m…scared. Sakura… I knew it. What shall we do? We should remove him\Nfrom the exams and isolate him with\NAnbu bodyguards on him. We should recommend that\Nhe retire immediately. He’s not the kind of type to\N just obey like that…?! After all, he’s of the Uchiha clan. What’re you talking nonsense for?! I’ll make him stop, by force if needed! The Curse Mark responds even\Nwhen one’s just building up Chakra and attempts to forcibly\Nextract his strength! It’s a prohibited Jutsu that eats\Ninto the body of the one who uses a Jutsu! It’s a wonder that kid is even enduring it. He should really already be dead! Lord Hokage! You’re in no condition to\Nfight properly, Sasuke…! Shut up. I understand! Be quiet! But you’ve been enduring the pain\Nthis whole time, right?! Please be quiet! No matter what you say, Sasuke... I’m going to tell the teachers\Nabout the bruise! If I do that... Well… Oh…?! What…? Excuse me…I’ll quit. K-Kabuto…? Let's see... Kabuto Yakushi of\Nthe Leaf Village, correct? Then, you may step back. Okay. Kabuto! Why’re you quitting?! Tell me! Why?! This guy… I’m sorry, Naruto… But my body is worn out. Actually before the first exam... when I wrangled with\Nthe guys from Sound Village, I’ve had no hearing at all in my left ear. To fight right away… and to be told that my life would\Nalso be on the line, I can’t go on. I’ve seen that face a few times. As I recall, I think he dropped out\Nof the main battle before, as well. What in the world is he thinking? Anko. Uh…yes. Kabuto Yakushi. According to the data,\Nhe has failed six straight times. What about his background? From his time at the Academy, he was a student who did\Nnot really stand out, and his grades were ordinary. He finally passed the graduation\N exam on his third try. After that, as for the missions\Nhe carried out, two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks. It’s not a battle record to\Nwrite home about. However… However…? It’s about before the Academy. Hmm? Do you remember the story... about the one boy brought back\Nfrom the Kikyo Pass battle? I remember. As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor\Nat the battlefield was taken back by a Jonin from\Nthe medical unit. So he’s that boy…? Don’t take arbitrary actions. Have you forgotten\NOrochimaru’s orders? I leave it to you guys. You in particular, Yoroi. There should be no problems\Nhere with your ability. This is where you can\Nshow your strength. Those of you who are irritated that\NI’m ahead of you. So you’re Orochimaru’s favorite, huh? Don’t get all high and mighty, kid. I understand, Yoroi sir. Oh. Naruto… Sasuke… I wanted to play with you guys\Na little more. But if I do more than this… The old me might get stirred up. I am a spy so far as it goes. I cannot expose myself, here. Also…if you are going to watch. My role of information collecting\Nhas served its purpose… Master Orochimaru. I’ll save the fun, for some other time… Sasuke… And Naruto... You too. Now then, there are no others\Nwho will quit? I must tell the teachers,\Nabout Sasuke’s bruise! Huh?! Be quiet about this bruise. Why’re you acting tough like that?! I don’t want to watch you suffer\Nall the time anymore! For me you are…! This has nothing to do with you! It’s none of your business. I said it once before… I’m an avenger. This is not just a mere exam to me. The Chunin business has\Nnothing to do with me. “Am I strong?”\NAll I want is the answer to that. By fighting with those who are strong! And… I’m Gaara of the desert. Hey, you there…\Nldentify yourself. I declare. You are absolutely no match for me. If I have the opportunity to fight you\Nin the next exam, we won’t run or hide. And they’re... here! I will not allow even you\Nto take my path away from me! Sasuke… You! What’re you doing putting up\Na front, you idiot?! Here Sakura is this worried about you--! Naruto! I want to fight you, too. Huh?! What Orochimaru said\Nis sitting on my mind. I will let Sasuke do the test... – and see how things go.\N– Wha--?! L-Lord Hokage…! However, if the Curse Mark opens and the power gets even a little bit\Nout of control, get in there and stop it. All right. But...! I understand. Now then, we will begin the preliminaries. The preliminaries to come\Nwill be one-on-one individual battles. In other words,\Nactual battle format. There are now exactly twenty people,\Nso we will conduct ten battles. The winners will be able to\Nadvance to the third exam. There are no rules at all. You will fight until someone dies,\N collapses…or admits defeat. And... please admit defeat right away\N if you don’t want to die. However, in case I judge\Nthat a match is over… err... I don’t want to needlessly increase\Ndead bodies, so I will intervene and stop the match\Nor something to that effect. What holds the key to your destinies is… Open it. This. The names of two foes will be\Nrandomly selected and displayed on this electronic signboard. Now then, let’s get right down to it and announce the two names\Nfor the first battle. Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha To think it’d be so soon…?! I couldn’t ask for more. No way…! Why Sasuke?! Now then, the two displayed on\Nthe signboard, come forward. For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and\NSasuke Uchiha have been selected. No objections, right? – Right. 					– No! All I can do now is watch… Sasuke… Sasuke! If you want to fight me, don’t lose! Sasuke… You’re acting strange… Is it because of the Curse Mark…? Sasuke, do your best! I guess I’ll wait and see… The pain won’t go away! It appears the Curse Mark hurts. Now then, we will begin the first battle. Everyone other than the two foes,\Nplease move to the upper area. Hey! Kakashi Sensei! Sasuke! Huh? Don’t use the Sharingan. So you knew? If that Curse Mark on your neck\Ngets out of control, it could endanger your life. I believe it. Well, the match will be\Ncalled off at that time. I’ll be coming in to stop it,\Nso good luck. Called off, you say?! It seems this Curse Mark thing\N is responding to my Chakra. This is my final Chakra… Sharingan! Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan! If I carelessly build up Chakra, it would extract my spirit energy, and bring out the Chakra\Ninside my body to no end. In other words, in this match, I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,\Nnot to mention the Sharingan! However... Yoroi’s ability is\N the worst for you, Sasuke. Now then… How will I go…? Don’t act rashly…Sasuke. Now then, please begin. Let’s go! Yeah! Oh no! He did it! My strength…?! W-What is this? My body strength has suddenly…! Sasuke! Sasuke…! You…my Chakra… You just noticed now…? Hey, can you hear it? The clear, blue sky goes on and on The ocean spans limitlessly Please keep that smile on your face forever Or else I’ll cry You won't have to search around you It’s all ok now. Everyone is inside\Nthis hand when you want to cry, and you want to run away When you forget what happiness is Just sing. Light is born, and darkness was born The two are one Harmonia, feel the telepathy Hey, can you hear it? Dang it!\NThe pain won't go away! This darned Curse Mark is\Nresponding all the time! But I won't let this\Nexam get called off! How will I do?\NHow should I fight? Am I strong? All I want is the answer to that. I won't let this thing swallow me up\Nin a place like this!

You shouldn’t say things\Nyou can’t even do. Shut up! What?! I told you. This bone is harder than steel. You should have a taste of it\Nwith your own body. Damn! There’s no one that’s heard\Nthis song and lived. Finale, Ninth Passage,\NDemon Revolution! The melody’s changed! Something’s gonna come! What the--?! What? This is…? The speed at which he flees\Nafter determining that these Material Ghosts\Nare dangerous… Pretty impressive. But… I’ve used my precious Paper Bombs\Nand Smoke Bombs all at once and all I could do was hide. That white one… bit off my physical energy. Seeing that shuriken passed through, that thing is semi-materialistic\Nwith very little mass. It's Chakra itself with an appetite. It’s probably Chakra that’s shaped\Nmostly by mental energy. That’s why it seeks stability\Nand craves for physical energy. If I continue dealing with\Nthose “Hungry Chakra” I won’t be able to build up my Chakra. They’re pretty dangerous. She’s a Shinobi who can\Nmake special Chakra like me… It’s without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu. Which means I should leave\Nthe white thing alone and aim for the main body! The quickest way would be\Nto stop the sound of the flute, but… it’d be impossible to get close to\Nthat woman in this situation. The next thing would be to capture\Nthose three with Shadow Possession Jutsu. But that's difficult too since they’re\Nattacking me separately at different times. If I let even one escape\NI’d be attacked and it’d be the end… There aren’t any openings in\Neither offense or defense this woman… Heh! She might be\Na pretty good Shogi player. My remaining Ninja tools\Nare twelve kunai knives, nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,\None Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb… Man… I feel like I’m playing without\Nrooks or bishops. Did I lose them? I guess that’s not possible… Akamaru? Here. Eat this, Akamaru. If you don’t eat you won’t\Nget your strength back. All right. Akamaru, let’s go! There’s the issue of those guys too… Dance of the Camellia! There’s no use hiding. Unless you can predict\Nthese guys’ movements there’s nowhere you can run, little rat. I’ll find you and break you\Ninto pieces right away! Now then... All right. Everything’s ready.\NAll that remains is to do it. There’ll be nine attacks. The outcome will be decided\Nduring the attacks. One! One! Wishful thinking! The Jutsu manipulated by\Nthis sound is invincible. Whatever plans you have\Nto win against me…is useless! Two! Scampering around, you little rat!\NWhere are you?! Three! So you’re over there! Four! So it’s a cheap trick.\NYou think you can make a fool of me?! Five…six… seven…eight… Scurrying around to get away.\NWhat is he thinking? Light?! Nine! Oh no! He’s lengthened the shadows\Nwith light and … Shadow Possession Jutsu! Shadow Possession Jutsu…\Na success! That’s impossible… How were you able to predict\Nthese guys’ movements?! There’s no way you could have heard\Nthe differences in my music patterns! I wasn’t listening to\Nthe sounds at all. There’s something other\Nthan the sounds that give away your command patterns,\Nisn’t there? Your fingers! It can’t be! The movement of the three... Are you saying you memorized\Nmy finger movements and predicted? There’s no way that’s possible! Your right index finger\Nand ring finger… The sound that you make\Nwith those along with the left middle finger\Nand pinkie, that middle crab pincher man\Nstands ready. Your right thumb and index finger, and your left index finger and pinkie,\Nthe club man charges. While you were dodging my attacks\Nand looking for me, I was observing each and every one\Nof your finger moves in detail… analyzing and memorizing them. It’s no use… They’re bound by\NShadow Possession Jutsu. The most interesting rule\Nof the Shogi play is that you can use pieces you obtain\Nas your own pieces. From here on out…\Nit’s my turn to attack… This time I’ll hunt you down\Nusing the three pieces. You’re looking pretty composed. Stand ready with a kunai knife\Nat least. My weapon is just this flute! I told you that there hasn’t been a person who’s heard the sound of\Nthis flute and lived, idiot! That’s some confidence! Retreat! Too bad you aren’t able to\Nuse the pieces, hey! Next it’s my turn! What?! Shadow Possession Jutsu,\Nsuccessful. I told you. That I’d hunt you down\Nusing the pieces. I used the three pieces as bait. In attacking, the first hand\Nis the trick, a fake. The basics are to score\Nwith the second hand. Bastard… It can’t be helped. Now that it’s come to this\NI’ll need to force out with power. I didn’t think that I’d get to\Nsecond state in a place like this… It ticks me off but… I’ll acknowledge it. This guy was a pretty impressive scum. What is…this? It’s true you’re somewhat sharp, but… It won’t go as\Nyou’ve planned from here! What?! Is she gonna force herself out\Nof the Shadow Possession Jutsu? What’s with that tremendous Chakra? The Jutsu’s gonna come loose! I can’t be worrying about\Nsaving Chakra anymore. There’s no other way\Nbut to use that Jutsu! Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu! Is he grabbing my body\Nwith the shadow? It’s just as if I’m being grabbed\Nby a real hand… But, no more than this! Damn! What an incredible strength. At this distance\NI’ll lose to that strength! Take this! Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia! This is bad! Is this a…Genjutsu? Where are you aiming? I can’t move my body… While in second stage, I manipulate many Genjutsu\Nwith my flute. Of those, this one is\Nan appropriate for that little rat. The reason is… This Genjutsu stops the movement\Nof the prey and ties it up! How’s that? How’s it feel to\Nbe the one tied up? So this was your last move huh?\NUnfortunately, it’s a return checkmate! Little rat! What…? This guy... He broke his own finger\Nwith his own shadow! Did he release the Genjutsu\Nwith that pain? On top of that, he kept pretending to\Nbe bound by the Jutsu?! I told you this already that the first hand is the trick,\Na fake. The basics are to score\Nwith the second move. Moreover this second move…\Nit’s a little different from earlier. With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu, the closer in distance you are\Nto the subject the stronger the hold. Damn. I carelessly got too close… No, that’s not it. The most careless thing was\Nthe words you said earlier, “my weapon is just the flute.” You’re looking pretty composed. Stand ready with a kunai knife at least. My weapon is just this flute! I told you that\Nthere hasn’t been a person who’s heard the sound of this flute\Nand lived, idiot! No way… That’s right. The reason I threw the kunai knife\Nright in front of you and missed… was to lead you to pick it up\Nand come closer to me, you see? For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words Would you think it was\Na bother if I approached you? Despite my doubts,\NI worked up my courage My clumsy attempts with words You listened without turning away No wonder I get carried away by you But you don’t feel anything for me, do you? I feel so sad But… For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you And you smiled For the first time, I was able to speak In my own words For the first time, I spoke to you No way, that’s ridiculous! Am I having a dream or something?! But it’s too intense to be a dream! That suit with its outstanding\Nventilation and supple fit. On top of that, those eyes,\Nthat hair, those eyebrows! You!

I never thought he’d attempt to use\Nthe Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu. But it’s still just this level… It’s completely different\Nfrom the original one. That Tsunade…\Nlncredibly strong as always. I remember a long time ago, getting punched by her and\Nknocked back nearly 100 meters… At any rate, Naruto’s hopeless. Are you okay? Jiraiya, was it you… who taught him that Rasengan,\Nthe Spiral Chakura Sphere? Rasengan…?! I’m his teacher, after all. Humph…You and the Fourth Hokage are\Nthe only ones who can use that Jutsu. Are you in your right mind… showing someone Jutsu\Nthat he can’t master? Don’t give him false hope. That’s why the moony kid starts joking\Nabout becoming a Hokage! It’s no joke! Stupid! Stupid! If I have three days,\NI’ll master this Jutsu! You said it, kid. Men don’t go back on their word! Hah! I stand by my words. That’s my Ninja Way. Then…how about a wager? A wager…? I’ll give you one week. If you can master that Jutsu, I’ll acknowledge that you have\Nwhat it takes to become the Hokage and give you this necklace. Lady Tsunade! That’s the precious--! I don’t need such a sorry necklace! Don’t say such things, Naruto… That’s the only one of its kind in this world. And you could buy three mountains\Nif you were to sell it. It belonged to the First Hokage. A-Awesome… Well, that’ll be fine! He’ll do anything for money…? Good… However, you lose if you can’t master\Nthe Jutsu in one week! And you’ll give me all the money\Nyou have on you. Oh! Gama-chan! When did she…?! Lady Tsunade! Why? That necklace is… He won’t be able to do it, anyway… Let’s go, Shizune. She never once used\Nthat necklace for a bet… You don’t have to answer right now. However, I want it in a week. Inheritance!\NThe Necklace of Death! Huh? Who is it this late at night? Okay, okay. I’m coming. I’m sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.\NI need to talk to you… As for me, I’m going to get\Na good night’s rest and train tomorrow! I’m sorry. But I didn’t want you\Nto misunderstand Lady Tsunade… As well as the necklace… Humph! I could care less\Nabout an old lady like that! Lady Tsunade is not the type\Nof person you think she is! Don't speak of her like that\Nwhen you don't even know her! I-I’m sorry…for raising my voice. She didn’t used to be like that. She was a kind person\Nwho loved the village. But, she changed… After that day… That day? What’s that day? The day she lost her dreams,\Nher love, her hopes… Everything. All that was left was\Nthat necklace of memories… It’s as precious as life to Lady Tsunade. It’s really not something\Nto be offered in a bet. I don’t care about that!\NShe bet it on her own, right?! Besides…that necklace is really\Nnot something for you to wear. It’s not just a necklace! It doesn’t acknowledge anyone\Nother than Lady Tsunade. If someone else wears it,\Nthat person inevitably… …dies! Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday! I’m not a kid anymore,\Nso I don’t need gifts on my birthday! What’re you saying?\NYou’re still a kid, aren’t you?! But never mind that.\NHurry up and open your present! You’ll definitely be pleased! Big Sister, could this be…? Yes… It’s the First Hokage’s,\Nour grandfather’s necklace! I love you, Big Sister! I thought it’d be better than me having it. You’ve been wanting it all along, right?\NTake good care of it. Not just this necklace! This village is grandfather’s treasure!\NI’m going to protect it! Nawaki… I’m the grandson of the Hokage who\Nbuilt the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…! You said it.\NMen don’t go back on their word! Right! Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather.\NAnd the Hokage name will be mine! Becoming the Hokage is my dream! Take off your headband, Nawaki. Just hurry up and take it off.\NI have another present for you. It’s a charm to make\Nyour dream come true. It’s best if you don’t look\Nat the remains. There’s nothing wrong with that,\Nis there? Even if she were to look, she wouldn’t be able to determine\Nthat it’s her little brother. Enough, Orochimaru! We are at war, now.\NAll Shinobi end up like this. There are no doctors on\Nthe battlefield, so… However, children really get\Nmuch too excited, don’t they? Especially on the day after\Nthey receive a present. Not just this necklace… This village is grandfather’s treasure!\NI’m going to protect it! First, in a mission where\Na Four-Man Cell must act alone for a long period of time\Nin enemy territory, by deploying one of the four\Nto be a medical specialist, the survival rate as well as\Nthe mission success rate should go up significantly. Therefore, establishing a framework to foster Ninja possessing\Nadvanced medical skills and the development of\Na medical institution should be considered\Nan urgent task for the present! Yes indeed, it’s as you say. But we’re in the middle of a war now. It takes too much time to\Nestablish a medical framework. And at present,\Nwe don't have enough knowledge… Enemies don’t wait. What did you say?! Hey, old man! Then we’ll never… I agree with her. I don’t want the lives of the Shinobi\Nwho died to be for naught. There should be something\Nwe can learn from that. Excuse me! Thanks for earlier. What you said was right. Umm… It’s late.\NShall I walk you home? What? Is that okay with you?\NWhere’s your home? The other way. Then don’t bother. I don’t mind.\NI also want to talk with you. And I would always use this path\Nto the Academy to pick up my little sister. I loved this path. What? You loved? Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf\Nwas attacked at night one year ago, my little sister was… This man…is the same as me. Tomorrow’s mission will be\Nwithin enemy lines… Fighting and losing cherished people\Nis not the only way for a Shinobi. Uh-huh. I’m living in a world of Shinobi\Nwhere death always hovers. I want to risk my life to bring\Nthis war-torn world under control. I love this village and my comrades. So I want to protect them. Since my little sister died,\Nthat sole thought has sustained me. So I’ll become the Hokage… An existence that protects everyone… Becoming the Hokage is my dream. Dan… I’d like you…to take this. Hang on, Dan! Tsunade… I don’t want…to die yet. I have many things that I must…do. Don’t talk, Dan! His kidney has been blown out… It’s futile even for Tsunade\Nwho is known as one of the Sannin… I…must not…die here. It’ll be okay. I stopped the bleeding. So it’ll be okay… You’ll be saved, Dan! Really? Thank goodness… Dan! Hang on! Dan! Dang it! Don’t come out… Stop… Please stop! Stop… Stop… Stop… Stop… Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop, I say! That’s enough. He’s dead! You understand, don’t you, Naruto…? Ever since that day, Lady Tsunade has been…\Nin a constant turmoil. Naruto…? I’m heading out…for training! Oh, you are already at it, I see! Hi, welcome! Why are you here? You’re cold. Don’t say that. Master Jiraiya… Shizune, could you leave us? It's been a while.\NI want to drink with her again. Master, sake! And some radish! Coming up! I’m counting on you, Master Jiraiya. Your radish is ready. Ooh. This looks good. At any rate, to think you’d still be taking\Ngood care of that necklace… I thought you’d have lost it\Nlong since to gambling. It’s a memento of those two, right? Is he on your mind…? Who? Naruto. Not particularly… Still, it’s immature,\Ntaking on that kid as an opponent… He shouldn’t be able to master\Nthat Jutsu in a week, right? That’s not what’s called a bet. What’s with the fit of despair? It’s not a fit of despair! Are you going to meet\NOrochimaru again? I can tell by looking at Shizune’s face. I don’t know what kind of deal\Nhe proposed, but don’t rush to a decision. And…let me just tell you one thing. The successive line of Hokages\Nhave protected the Leaf Village and those living in it. They brought troubled times under control\Nand helped the village to prosper. They risked their lives\Nfor this dream, this ideal! You're not someone who can't understand\Nthe feelings of the previous Hokages. Just try doing something\Nto betray the Leaf Village. When that happens, I’ll kill you myself! It has nothing to do with me now! A person who has experienced\Nthe death of people close to them and doesn’t feel anything\Nis just a butcher. You’re different, aren’t you? No one cared for the welfare\Nof the villagers more than you. At that time, too… That’s enough with the lecture! Why…did you bring that kid? Becoming the Hokage is my dream. He resembles him, doesn’t he? His age is about the same, too… Not just that… Becoming the Hokage is my dream! Geez, you do nothing,\Nbut reckless things. Do you want to die? You’re still a Genin,\Nso on the battlefield just run away. Don’t tell a man to “run away”! That dream… And his cockiness as well… No good! Dang it! Dang it!\NTomorrow, for sure…! My head hurts. I totally got sick from drinking,\Nthanks to her… It seems Naruto never came home\Nlast night… He's such a fool. Why don’t we make a deal? I’ll resurrect the little brother\Nand man, both of whom you loved… with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed. Don’t you want to see those two,\NTsunade? If I treat your arms… What do you intend to do with them? This time, I will completely\Ndestroy Leaf Village! No! You must not believe\Nin their sweet talk… Their wishes… Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…\NAnd dreams… Did you forget them ?! I’ll be straight with you. Tsunade, the village has demanded\Nthat you become the Fifth Hokage. I believe your promise,\Nits a true heart give me courage Always I feel it\Nthe precious time with you On your still shoulder I feel the wind that blows\Ntowards tomorrow The city lights are like pieces of stars That hold us together “Each one of us glows differently,” you say laughingly but you look most dazzling Like a comet, like the rainbow after the storm You bring light into my heart Being lost can be the answer Let’s promise we won’t cheat Uh... like a shooting star,\Nwe do go ahead. Darn it! What am I doing?! I fell asleep at such\Nan important time! Moreover, today is the day\Nof the bet! Meanwhile, I don't even know where\Nthat old lady Tsunade has gone to!

I chased after him,\N but he got away… This is bad… Now that Shiin knows the villagers\Nwon’t abandon their homes and get out, he’ll use his last resort. There is a dam built upriver to secure\Nwater resources during a drought. There is enough water for the village\N to last a year, even if it doesn’t rain. The dam has been rigged to blow up and to sweep away\Nthe entire village with a flood. All they care about\Nis the mine. We can’t stop something like a flood unless we move mountains\Nor something! Mountains… That’s it.\NWe should move mountains! Naruto! Take me to the mine. Wha--? There should be a bunch of\NLetter Bombs in the mine! Letter Bombs?!\NWhat’re you going to do with those?! I’m going to blow up\N the mine itself. The crumbled dirt and sand will\N fill up the valley and the flood can be stopped. Damn it! He’s started!\NLet’s hurry, Menma! Naruto… There’s something\N I have to tell you. Make it later! I haven’t lost my memory. Yeah… But stopping\Nthe flood comes first! No, I’d like you to listen now. I lost my parents when I was little\Nand was raised in Shiin’s clan. They were a small Shinobi clan even\Nin the Land of Rice Paddies. But they still had ambitious plans… However, a Shinobi village was created\N in the Land of Rice Paddies about a year ago. It was the Village Hidden in the Sound. The Village Hidden in the Sound! Clan members confident in their skill drifted over to Hidden Sound Village\N one after another. Eventually jobs from\Nthe feudal lord stopped coming. Shiin the leader of the clan that\Nhad lost its means of livelihood set his eyes on the mine in this village… The plan was to just threaten\Nand chase off the villagers. But I encountered\Nunexpected resistance, and I got scared and tried to escape… What’re you hesitating for?\N Hurry up and take care of him. Father! Father! Stop it! You… You jerk! Look out! I’m a member of a clan that\Nhas committed crimes. It would’ve been better if\NI’d just died like that… How easy things would’ve been\N if I could’ve died then… I got scared thinking about\N the villagers who died… I wanted to forget. And so I cowardly escaped into\Na Jutsu passed down through the clan that erases memory. However, the Jutsu didn’t work\N very well… I only temporarily lost my memory\Nand it came back in a few hours. Then you had your memory\N the whole time?! I’m sorry… Knock it off! Then why didn’t you tell me about\Nthat honestly from the start?! If you had, it would’ve been… I didn’t have the courage to make\Nthe crimes of the clan public. But I thought the clan must\Nnot commit any further crimes. So I pretended to lose\Nmy memory. And to prevent the clan from\Nadding to their crimes… I wanted to bring some of you\N Leaf Shinobi here and have you help out. I knew of Shiin’s next plan. There must not be any\N more village casualties. Stopping that is my duty\Nfor having survived. Duty…? I needed the help\Nof the Leaf Shinobi before Shiin could\Nexecute his next plan… I wanted to round them all up\N during the attack earlier. But since things have come this far,\NI’ll stop the flood. Thanks, Naruto… I leave Shiin to you.\NFind and stop him, no matter what. You… This…? This is goodbye. Somebody has to blow up\Nthe Letter Bombs inside… If you do that, you’ll…! Thanks to you, my life has\N taken on more meaning… What’s that sound? There are intermittent explosions\Noccurring upriver… The village will be engulfed in\Na mudslide if the dam breaks! No…! Neji… It’s coming! Goodbye… Naruto… Menma! Wh-What happened…? It seems the crumbled mountain\N stopped the mudslide… Then, that means the village is saved? Yeah… – Thank goodness!\N– That’s a relief… H-How can that be?! Menma!! That jerk…! He won’t get away!\NShadow Clone Jutsu! Hold it! Interfering with our plan! You think such a Jutsu will work\N on me… Huh?! Die! I’ll stop you in Menma’s place! What?! Rasengan! He sacrificed his life to save\N the village, huh…? No matter what his past was,\Nhe was a good guy at heart… Mister… I wanted to say a word of apology. Not being able to remember\Nanything until the end might have been salvation for him… It was a promise, right?\NTo eat this with you. You don’t need\Nto say anything to him?

Humans aren’t such a big deal Who needs tomorrow anyway, so don’t hide your fists You’re not old enough to sell your dreams away to uncertainty Hey boys, you’re the only ones who can pull the trigger in your heart All the kids said We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous, awesome world right at this moment, All the kids said Don’t forget every truth or lie All the kids said We’re way too young to die In this empty town lined with empty faces All the kids took off into this windless night Because they want to change something Funeral March for the Living Wh-Why… Why does such\Na good man have to…die?! It’s sad… 					lt’s so sad! I remember now… I forgot when,\Nbut you showed it to me, didn’t you? With a twinkle in your eye, you proudly said it was\Na memento of your father. That was the pipe box, wasn’t it?\Nlt was an amazing box. No wonder you’re so proud of it… Even though I took it and smashed it,\Nyou only laughed. You were smiling when\Nwe kicked you and tossed you. It was a great smile. Really… Hold it in, Rokusuke!\NThey’ll all be gone. If we let this moment go, there will be no other chance\Nto get out of the village. But Kanpachi is…! It’s for the village, we have to do something and\Nmake our way to that village! Yeah… Funerals are awesome, aren’t they! I wanna do that again. One…two…three people…\Ngot away again… Looks like we can have\Nanother funeral. This is… The Village Hidden in the Leaves. You are…? Naruto Uzumaki! Right now,\NI’m in the middle of training. The Village Hidden in the Leaves… H-Hey! I said hey! Hang in there! This is training too…! I can’t give up yet! Not yet! The escort for the ruler of\Nthe Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu, was completed without incident! Well done. That’s Lady Tsunade’s…! Excellent dumplings are always\Nfrom the Leaf Village, aren’t they? That was my last one! Mission Accomplished! I came to pound the pirates\Nof the Gottani Channel with the fist of love! If they take this opportunity\Nto rehabilitate themselves, it’s worth while to shed a tear! I’ll have your team do it for me. Yes? Even though we’re already busy,\Nthat Naruto brought in more work. After this, Guy has the S-rank mission. The client picked him,\Nso he must depart today. So, do it without Guy. That’s pretty straightforward… I called Neji Hyuga,\NTenten and Lee. Ohh! My pupils can undertake the fulfillment\Nof this mission without incident! Wait… Take Naruto Uzumaki, too. Why can't it just be my pupils,\Nwho are loved by all the world? Please answer me, Lady Tsunade! It just is. Hidden Leaf Hospital Those three people that Naruto saved\Ncame all the way from the Katabami Gold Mine\Nto request a mission. Katabami Gold Mine is one of\Nthe Land of Rivers’ greatest mines, but about half a year ago, hooligans\Ncalling themselves the Kurosuki family appeared on the pretext of guarding it,\Nand took control of the village… killing villagers for\Nno particular reason. How vile! Your mission is this: Once those three have\Nregained their strength, escort them to Katabami Gold Mine\Nand eliminate the Kurosuki family. It’s a simple mission. Well anyway, it must be a group\Nof punks who’re after money. Why did you call me for\Nsuch an easy mission? Who do you think you are? I’m busy searching for\NSasuke and training, and--! You forced your way into missions\Nthat you weren’t called for. It’s not a Genin’s place\Nto choose his missions! Would you like to be sent back\Nto the Academy? Well?! Neji Hyuga! Yes! You’re the leader! It will be good training for you\Nto try to tame the unstable. I don’t want to…\Nbut, I’ll do it! I’ll go continue my training! Hey Naruto! Please excuse them.\NThey have no manners… Wait! Those little brats…! What the heck do\Nthey think missions are?! Umm, excuse me? What?! The Kurosuki Family… What did you say\Ntheir boss’ name was? Raiga! That’s what I thought… What? Well, on a previous mission,\NI heard a rumor about him. A rumor…? Pervy Sage hasn’t returned…\NI’m forced to go on a mission… Oh, this is irritating… Sakura! Naruto? What’s going on? A bird? Yesterday I found it injured\Nand treated it, but… Sakura, that’s amazing! But poor thing. It’s separated from its friends. Naruto! Oh, sorry, did I intrude? You intruded big time! No, no! Don’t turn your back,\Nno need to grovel to youth. Sakura, Hello! Hello! What did you come here for? – Just to have a word.\N– Huh? What the--?! Oh, Sakura, goodbye! – Hey! What was that?!\N– She went wild, didn't she? She should act her age. Ichiraku\N		What?! The boss of\N		the Kurosuki family is one of the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist? Yeah, it’s exclusive information\Nfrom our respected teacher, Guy. Who’re the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist? Naruto, you said that you fought in the Land of\Nthe Waves mission, didn’t you? At that time… Oh, Zabuza! And? And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei\Nfought Kisame Hoshigaki. I heard that\Nyou met them there too, Naruto. Oh! I know that guy! Those two were once called the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist. And at that time,\Nwho was with Kisame Hoshigaki? Oh! The man called Itachi!\NAnd then? You still don’t understand? If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords\NMen of the Mist, then he’s probably tied to Itachi\Nwho was with Kisame. Oh! And? Tell me, who's after Itachi? I know! Sasuke! That’s right! We can probably get\Nthe clue to Sasuke’s whereabouts at Katabami Gold Mine! But… If that’s what Guy Sensei said then… Don’t say anything rude! It's information that's\N100% reliable! Starting now,\Nwhile guarding Rokusuke and the others, we head toward Katabami Gold Mine to fulfill our mission to\Nwipe out the Kurosuki family. There’s a shop I’m familiar\Nwith close to the gold mine. Let’s make that the base. What do you mean\Na shop you’re familiar with? That’s the fun part of the trip. That aside, that Naruto is late… If the source of the information\Nis Guy Sensei, maybe he couldn’t quite trust it? That’s not true!\NNaruto will definitely come! That’s because Guy Sensei’s\Ninformation is correct! Whatever. Here I am! We’re all here so…! Is that for you to say?! Let’s go! So…which way? Don’t be so anxious, Rokusuke, Those guys will save our town. It’s post-meal training! I won’t lose! I won’t lose! How long do you intend\Nto rest here?! If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi\Nfrom the burial… Give it up… How long do you think\Nit’s been since that happened? It’s painful but… I remember…this sleepiness.\NThe shop is close by. You say you’re sleepy,\Nand are you walking in your sleep?! It’s okay. I slept while on a marathon on\Nthis road for three days straight. You are joking, right? It’s true. The track meet of my youth\Nwith Guy Sensei. My body still remembers it. I’ve gotten sleepy. Hey, Bushy Brow,\Nare you really okay? That’s right. In this area,\Nthere’s the scent of spicy curry. Curry? Now that you mention it… That’s right! Over there, it’s…\Nthe Curry of Life Shop! Grandma Sansho! Oh my… 					Oh goodness! I haven’t seen you for a while! – Oh my my my!\N– You're looking well! This is the shop Lee is familiar with? That mountain is\Nthe Katabami Gold Mine Grandma Sansho’s curry saved my life. So you’re saying\Nit’s delicious curry? No, it really saved my life.\NI’m indebted to this curry. It was when\NI’d just become a Genin … When Guy Sensei gave me\Na special training routine. Oh my, that’s right.\NI remember. Do your best! Oh my… Hey Grandma Sansho! Oh my, they’ve come again! Those people are running in their sleep. Karashi! Karashi! If you had that kind of energy,\Nyou wouldn’t lose to the bullies. Oh my,\NI might have said too much. Curry of Life Shop Oh my! It’s the third day. They’ve been running the whole time. Oh my. What a problem. I wonder if he’s hungry…? What a pickle! He's not waking up! Maybe I didn't use\Nenough spice? Karashi… I’ve never seen a person\Nwho works this hard. Oh really… so you want to help\Nthis young man too…? This is the curry of life. Now! Grandma Sansho went to\Nthe trouble of making this curry. Let’s eat! I’m digging in! Yum!\NThis is yummy-yum delicious! Delicious! The use of spices\Nis wonderful! And this rice\Ngoes perfectly with the curry! Delicious! By the way, I don’t see Karashi. Karashi saw how hard you worked and became a bright kid\Nfull of energy, but… He got too much energy\Nand left for town. What? I was wrong to keep telling him\Nto be stronger. “I’m going to be a man! “I’m going to be part of\Nthe Kurosuki family,” he said. Oh my! I’m not blaming you.\NDon’t worry. It's too late. I’m responsible… Oh my. Neji! Please include Karashi’s rescue\Ninto our mission! We’ll bring him back from\Nthe road of evil! It’s fine. We’ll use this shop as a base\Nand take a good look into the village. Then we’ll come up with a strategy\Nand spring into action. Yes! You guys await orders here. Because it’s dangerous\Nif the Kurosuki family finds us. It’s a disaster! Rokusuke! Rokusuke!\NHe's gone! I’m sure he went to town alone! That’s not good! If those guys find Rokusuke…! Now that it’s come to this, we don’t have time\Nto come up with a strategy! Let’s get right to it! No! We’ll get right to it! Let's hurry. Wait for me, Kanpachi,\NI’m coming now… Someone… is coming… Aw, again…\NI have to put on a funeral! Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?

Ideal practice for becoming…Hokage? If you’re going so far as to say that,\Nthen it can’t be helped… It’s too bad… Whoa! Kidding, kidding,\Nkidding, just kidding! Say so sooner if that’s the case. Practice for becoming Hokage… Yeah-yeah…\NThat has a nice ring to it. He fell for it. Jeez, he’s naïve… Naruto… Now then,\Nmy adorable team members…are… These guys…? Oh! Why the heck are you\Non that side?! Man, I don’t want to do such\Na troublesome mission either. Shikamaru will be\Nan assistant to us instructors. I will now begin the explanation\Nof the outdoor training to be conducted over\None night and two days. This is the spot you all\Nwill be setting out for… Great Stone Face of Warudakumi\Non the summit of Mount Takurami. The team leader will not take routes\Nother than the ones indicated on the map… in order to ensure the safety\Nof the Academy students. Along the way, there will be obstacles such\Nas instructors disguised as enemy Ninja, as well as trap and the like. But you Academy students\Nshould be able to safely evade them if you act according to the instructions\Nof your team leaders. You’ll see\Nthe Stone Face of Warudakumi after you cover about\Neighty kilometers. The team that brings the secret document\Nhidden there back to the village… will have completed the training\Nupon crossing the finish line. There is only one secret document. This will be a competition\Nwith the other teams. All right.\NWe’ll finish first, no matter what! You guys ready?! – Yeah! 					– Yeah! An important thing about survival is\Nacquiring food with your own resources… This is called Beef Sashimi Grass\Nand it grows in this area… You can eat it raw and it becomes precious food\Nwhen the chips are down… – Wow! 					– Wow! All right! All members acquire food! – Yay! 					– Yay! This is it! Let’s eat… That’s a Blowfish Sashimi Grass.\Nlt’s a very similar poisonous grass. See? The shape of the leaf\Nis a bit different, right…? You two be careful as well, okay? – Okay! 					– Okay! Listen up, an important thing in survival\Nis to acquire food by your own resources. Something’s not right! Disappointing, isn’t it…? I’ve got an uneasy feeling… Let’s see… The geography in this area\Nthrows magnets out of kilter… When you can’t use a compass… Huh? You’re wearing a watch, right? Oh…yes! Look for the bisecting angle, which divides the 12:00 direction and the\Ncurrent direction of the hour hand in two… And then, when you line up that direction\Nwith the sun as of now… the approximate 12:00 direction is south. Remember that! – Okay! 					– Okay! Let’s…see… Huh? This way…? Hey, Konohamaru… This way? No doubt about it… He’s totally lost… Right, right! Yikes…This is bad, believe it. A-All right! This way! Come with me, believe it! Will it be okay? That was a more challenging route\Nthan I thought, wasn’t it, guys? Challenging, my foot!\NWe’re back at where we came from! Man, we can’t trust you,\NBrother Naruto! Then why don’t you try?! Give me that! Oh… It’s this way. N-Not bad… What’s the matter, Konohamaru?! What’re you doing, Konohamaru?!\NGive me that!

A report from the observatory… Wow… It’s warm… Good thing we listened to you\Nand prepared it ahead of time. We would’ve been soaked if we were even a little slow\Nputting up the tent!

This path isn’t on the map. We fell behind the others more\Nthan I thought. We can’t be resting Then, this path… Yeah… It’s not on the map.\Nlt’s a shortcut route! – What?! 					– What?! Will this be okay?! What’re you doing?!\NWe’ll be late if we don’t hurry! Don’t talk nonsense! We haven’t learned that method\Nof climbing! Right!

Let go, Konohamaru! If I let go, he’ll blow away! Let go of the bag, Udon! I-I can’t…! It can’t be helped… No! I can’t hold on any longer! That was a close one! I issued an evacuation advisory to all the teams encamped\Nat the foot of the mountain. I see… Now all that’s left is\NNaruto’s team… Iruka Sensei! I found this on an unplanned route… An unplanned route, you say?! What do we do now?\NWe’ve lost our tent and our food… There’s no point in saying that! What?! It’s because you put your foot\Non my backpack in the first place… What’re you talking about?! If my foot hadn’t gotten caught,\Nwe would’ve blown away. Now, now…\NStop fighting, believe it. Why didn’t you close the zipper, Udon?! Sorry… Now, now…\NDon’t say that, Konohamaru! When you get right down to it, it’s your fault for entering a strange route,\NBrother Naruto! Right, right! What? We got behind because you got caught in a trap\Nand were lost forever! Hey, what did you say?! You can’t justify yourself, can you?! We could’ve gotten through faster\Nif you guys hadn’t gotten in the way! It’s because our leader’s\Nnot dependable! What?! Heh! How silly! – What did you say?!\N– What did you say?! What?! Ohh… I’m hungry…\NTemporary ceasefire. This is the spot. That Naruto… After all I told him about\Nfollowing instructions!

It’s all stuff we need hot water for… About the only thing we can eat\Nis the baumkuchen cake… I’m hungry… You’re asking too much! This is survival, so it’s common sense to have things ready\Nthat can be eaten right away! Right, right! I won’t share if you’re going to complain! I’m taking the big one. The biggest one…is mine! The big one… The big one… Okay, eat up! What…? But… It’s divided in three? You’re not having any here,\NBrother Naruto? Back in the day, I also went without food once\Nwhen I screwed up during training. We couldn’t all pull together\Nand Kakashi Sensei got mad at us… Cripes! Who cares about\Nthree working as one?!

What a pain he is… It seems they were here\Nuntil just a little while ago… He really does cause…trouble. The finish line is right\Nbefore our eyes! That method of climbing isn’t fair,\NI tell you!

Konohamaru… We can’t do it…\NLet’s call for help-- Brother said it before! The important thing for\Na Ninja is teamwork! Konohamaru, you… No!

You can do anything… …if you get serious! You guys… Konohamaru Gang!\NHelp Brother Naruto! – Yeah! 					– Yeah! Be careful! Easy does it! Yeah. But hurry. It moved…Time it right and\Ntoss it away in one shot. Got it! One, two…! Yes! It’s a big success! We did it, we did it! That was a close one… – Naruto! 					– Naruto! You guys okay? Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru! Naruto! Above you! Shadow Clone Jutsu! Run towards Shikamaru! – Brother Naruto!\N– Brother Naruto! Naruto! Rasengan! Naruto… Man, making us get all nervous… Excellent, Brother Naruto… Thank goodness! Yeah! So, what’s the meaning of this? So you see… It was all Brother Naruto’s orders! We were opposed, but he forced us to move ahead\Nsaying the only way to finish first was to take a dangerous shortcut! I said many times we shouldn’t\Nbecause it’s dangerous! But… – Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!\N– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead! What…? What? It seems that’s about the size of it…\NYou’re prepared, right, Naruto?

Although the sand will protect you… Yashamaru… I’m sorry… Oh, this..? It’s just a scrape. A scrape… Is it painful? A little bit… But it’ll heal in no time. Hey Yashamaru… What is it? What is pain? I’ve…never once had a wound so… I wondered what it’s like… Well… How can I explain it? It’s like it’s distressing, or difficult… In other words, to be hit or cut… Maybe I should say it’s a feeling\Nof not being able to bear it, of not being able to stay normal… I can’t say it well, but I suppose it means a situation\Nthat’s not very good. Yashamaru… Yes? So, do you dislike me…Yashamaru? People live their lives while\Nhurting others and while being hurt. But it’s not so easy for\Npeople to dislike others. Thank you, Yashamaru. I think I sort of understand\Nwhat pain is now. I see… So…maybe I’m injured too?\NThe same as everyone? I'm always…in pain. I’m not bleeding, but… I’ve been having a lot of\Npain around…here. Blood does flow from a wound\Non the body and the wound may appear painful. But as time passes, the pain\Nnaturally disappears. By using medicine,\Nthe healing is even faster. But what’s dangerous is\Na wound of the heart. Nothing has more trouble healing. A wound of the heart? A wound on the body and\Na wound of the heart are slightly different. Unlike a wound on the body,\Nthere is no ointment and sometimes, it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life. But there is one thing that\Ncan cure a wound of the heart. However, this is a complicated medicine. It can only be given to you\Nby another person. What? What must I do to…? The thing that can cure\Na wound of the heart. That is… love. Love? Yes. H-How can I get it?\NWhat do I need to do for this pain to be…? It has already been given to you, Gaara. Huh? Love is…a heart that desires to serve\Na precious person who is close to oneself, to love and watch over that person,\Njust like my older sister did. I believe that my older sister\Nloved you, Gaara.

As we survived through\Nthe changing seasons, we gained knowledge and strength,\N(just looks like a survival game) But the forgotten memories, of the feelings abandoned within\Nthe flows of time, have also been lost.

I hear it’s been a bit of\Na construction boom recently. Seems like a lot of the construction sites\Nare short-handed and they’re hiring carpenters\Nfrom people outside of the country, too. Even I know that. Oh, Old Man Genno! Oh… Naruto. Who is he? He’s a carpenter from the Land of Sand. He likes ramen, and we bump\Ninto each other at Ichiraku. How about we go there after this? Yeah! Here you go,\Nthanks for waiting! Thank you for this meal! Thank you. Ichiraku’s ramen is the best, after all! Isn’t it so? Isn’t it so? I’m sorry, but can I have some water…? Sure! Thank you for this meal! That was fast! Are you full already? No… Not really… Then, I’ll give you mine. Lucky! Hey, Naruto! The two of them are always like this. They act as if they’re really\Ngrandfather and grandson. Oh come on, Sakura,\Nstop being so harsh. There’re lots of other people\Nwho complain. Like Grandma Tsunade. And there’s Shino, Ino, Kiba,\Nand Kakashi Sensei… But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura. Come on, Naruto! That’s only because\Nyou’re always at fault! Now, now, Sakura calm down.\NYou hair will turn gray… Ouch! – Looks like it’s time\N– Just leave it and eat up already! – I got to business…\N– But I got nothing left! – Hey, hey.\N– Help me, Old Man Genno! Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather Damn! What is it? Fog? Well, I guess it doesn’t matter… Lady Tsunade. I’m sorry to bother you\Nduring your sleep, but the man that the Anbu Black Ops\Nhave had marked… Has made his move? He is currently on the run. On the run? Are you telling me even with\Nthe array of the Anbu Black Ops, we still can’t catch him? Who is he? You must know his identity by now. There was nobody in\Nthe recent Bingo Book that fit his description, but when we checked\Nan older Bingo Book… Genno? Genno the Trapper? You do know of him? He should be quite old by now. I hadn’t heard his name in a while, so I thought that\Nhe had already retired, but… I never would have thought that\Nhe was infiltrating the Leaf Village. I guess I can’t fight against old age. No… I guess I should say this is just\Nwhat I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops. We want you to hand over the thing\Nyou took from the master carpenter’ house. You think I would still be holding\Nonto that thing? I've had a long life as a Shinobi… I guess it wouldn’t be so bad to\Nclose the curtain at this time. Though I regret that\NI won’t be able to see the end of the Leaf Village\Nwith my own eyes! Paper Bombs! Retreat! Are you saying that someone is planning a huge attack\Nagainst the Leaf Village?! That would be the only reason\Nanyone would want those plans besides carpentry purposes. Genno’s last words suggest that as well. It’s going to take some time\Nto decipher those plans, but it’s too dangerous to depend on that. The enemy may\Nattack us any minute. Activate the S-Level Emergency\NSecurity Alert! Leave the least amount of\Nmen necessary here, and all other men are to secure\Nthe border! Attack anyone who tries to cross\Nthe border! Don’t allow them to attack the village,\Nno matter what! Such great weather! Naruto! Oh! Sakura! That sound like a big pain in the ass. I think you’ll be able to do it.\NThat is why we left you in the village. At the very least, is there any way\Nthat we can get more people? Under these circumstances,\Nwe can’t turn over more people to you. They’re the greatest line-up for you,\Naren’t they? The greatest…huh? Fog? Last night’s weather didn’t seem\Nlike it was going to be foggy. How strange…\NWas it all a dream? Doesn’t it seem like\Nwe’re really low on people? That’s what I was thinking, too. From the looks of it, the village must be\Nunder special security alert. What?! For real?!\NI didn’t notice it! You should notice these kinds of things.\NYou’re a Ninja. But if we’re in a state of emergency, it’s a huge deal for the village,\Nisn’t it? Why haven’t they told us anything? That’s why Lady Tsunade is calling us. Come in. Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto. Shikamaru… So you must’ve been left out, too. Huh? What are you taking about? Nothing… Oh, hey Shikamaru.\NAbout last night’s weird fog… Did you see it? Stop it.\NYou were just dreaming. There was no fog. See. I told you… That was a smoke screen. Smoke screen? I’ll explain once\Neveryone gets here. – Huh? 					– Naruto, Sakura… The reason why we left you out of the S-Level Emergency\NSecurity Alert unit is because we wanted you\Nto work under Shikamaru for a special mission. What? Well, that’s the case. First, I want you to gather\Nthe people I’m about to name. Hey, calm down, Naruto! But it’s already past the time\Nwe were supposed to gather! Not quite. To be accurate,\Nwe still have twenty more seconds. Seems like he’s here. Oh? Everyone’s already here? No matter how you look at it,\Nyou’re the last one! Everyone’s here now.\NThen let’s begin. I’m sure that\Nyou all have already noticed. The village is currently under\Nthe S-Level Emergency Security Alert. It all started when… The smoke screen last night, right? You guys noticed it? Of course. The bugs were being noisy… Huh? I didn’t notice it. You’re always so out of it! SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI!\N		I didn’t notice it either… WORSE THAN NARUTO!!\N		Could it be then that\N		I’m worse than Naruto? Worse than Naruto… Worse than\NNaruto… Worse than Naruto… So what was that? It seemed like something involving\Nthe Anbu Black Ops. So I stayed put… Yeah, that’s correct.\NThe Anbu Black Ops were involved. Just as I thought… It was late last night. A man that the Anbu Black Ops had\Nbeen marking for the past two weeks had snuck into the home of\NLeaf Village’s top carpenter boss… And he stole the plans of our village’s\Nimportant facilities from the secret safe. Plans…? So what’s so bad about that? He just stole the plans\Nfor the facilities, right? Just stole? You’re so… Naruto… For example, let’s say the plans for\Nthe fort that surrounds the village fell into enemy hands… By analyzing those plans in detail, the enemy could figure out\Nthe most efficient way to break into the village. Now let’s say that there were\Nplans for Lady Tsunade’s mansion. If you were to examine those plans, you could find out how\Nto get the Lady Tsunade’s room. And if the plans were to get\Ninto the hands of an assassin… That’s really, really bad. Last night’s smoke screen was… something that suspect spread\Nas he was running away. I see… In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him\Nin the Western Forest… He killed himself before\Nthey could get him to talk. Unfortunately,\Nwhen he committed suicide, he wasn't in possession\Nof the plans he had stolen. If the plans have already fallen\Ninto the hands of the enemy… it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of\Nthe Destruction of Leaf Village. In order to prevent that from happening The S-Level Emergency Security Alert\Nwas deployed this morning. So, what is the mission for those\Nof us who were left behind? Find out the location of\Nthe stolen plans and bring them back. That's our mission. It’s like finding a needle in\Na haystack. We just need to investigate\Nthe path he took and people he was acquainted with. It turns out that the guy was famous\Nfor being a top-level trap technician. It’s a huge possibility that\Nhe left traps where the plans are. It’s definitely plausible. I understand.\NWe’ll follow your instructions. I’ll do it. Then let’s start the investigation. Turns out that the man\Nhad snuck into the village a few months ago and worked\Nas a carpenter. Th-This guy… His name is…Genno You’re kidding me. There’s no way! Old Man Genno loved\Nthe ramen at Ichiraku! He would never do anything that\Nwould destroy the Hidden Leaf Village! Listen… There’s no way that a guy\Nwho’s sneaking in to an enemy village would show his bad side. He played the part of a good guy\Nto let people’s guard down. There is no way that anyone\Nwho loves ramen could be a bad person! No. That’s not true Naruto. Choji… You tell him.\NPut some sense into this guy. Anyone who loves Ichiraku’s ramen\Ncan't be a bad person! Choji! Gosh, I can’t depend on anybody… This is a list of the stolen plans. I'm so embarrassed\Nwe lost our important plans… I can’t show my face to Lady Tsunade. Which construction jobs\Nwere Genno involved with? None of them. But wasn’t he working under you? I don’t allow outsiders to work\Non any construction that involves the safety of the village. That old man only worked\Non residential construction. Which means… There’s little possibility that he\Nsnuck some traps into the construction. I think it’s impossible. We should check everything,\Njust in case… I’m counting on you. Lady Hinata, please take care of these. Y-Yes! I’ll go too. Me too. I’ve mentioned it earlier,\Nbut there is a possibility the the plans haven't fallen into\Nthe enemy's hands yet. It’s possible that he could have hidden it\Nwhile he was running away. And it’s our mission to find that. Understood. It’s the start of a treasure hunt.\NI’m depending on you Akamaru. Go! Ino and Sakura, you guys go\Ncheck the old man's body. There might be some clues. What?! Us? I got it. All right! You just want me to go right?!\NI’ll go! Sakura, are you really okay with this? I have to be. I’m training to become\Na Medical Ninja. I can’t be afraid of something like this. That might be the case for you, but… Now…master carpenter. Can you tell us everything you know\Nabout Old Man Genno? The old man came to Leaf Village\Nabout three months ago… He came to my place with\Na recommendation letter from a famous master carpenter\Nfrom the Land of Sand. As you may already know, there’s a bit of a construction boom\Nin Leaf Village. Every place is in need of more people. And we needed more hands ourselves, so we decided to hire him right away. His carpeting skills…\Nwere all right, just average. I didn’t feel the urge to\Nhire him permanently, nor did I feel like I wanted to\Nfire him right away. He took his job seriously. He was perfect to hire\Nwhen we were short on people. But after a while, I found out that the recommendation letter\Nhe brought was a fake. This is the recommendation letter\Nhe brought. And how is this a fake? There was a guy who brought\Na recommendation letter from the same master carpenter\Nmore than ten years ago. I just happen to find that\Nrecommendation letter, so I compared it and I noticed\Nthat the handwriting was different… And that recommendation letter? It’s over there in that cabinet… Oh? Where did I put it?\NI know I put it here… It’s okay if you don’t have it. I’m sorry. For us, we really didn’t care if\Nhis recommendation letter was a fake as long as he didn’t do anything bad. I just thought that I should let things\Nlike this be known to Lady Tsunade… I didn’t think that\Nthe old man was a Shinobi from another country\Nand that he would steal our plans… I still can’t believe it. Hey, is it really that\Nold man’s doing? I can’t believe it either. There're no signs of traps… All right. This is where the old man lived, huh? He always paid the rent on time. He really was quite proper… Once in a while he’d come home\Nafter drinking with his carpenter friends, but he would never cause trouble. Well, I did predict it,\Nbut there are no clues… I found it! What did you find? A special bonito broth, refreshing udon\Nand light broth super thin udon! We’re not looking for food! But usually if somebody\Nis living by himself, he’d probably stack up\Non a bit more food… There’s only instant cup-udon. Didn’t he eat out a lot?\NI hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot… Right, Naruto? Oh… Yeah. If he cooked himself, he could have\Neaten more and saved money… Choji, we’re not talking about you. That old man\Nbarely talked about himself… Just as I expected. Oh, but he did happily talk about how he became friends\Nwith one of the kids in the village. He might have heard something\Nfrom the old man. Oh, I wonder about that. What you mean you wonder about that? We won’t know until we find the kid\Nand question him, won’t we? But it seems like there’s no need for us\Nto look for him or question him. What?! Then, where is this guy! Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto! What?! Me?! Yeah, there’s no mistake about that. You’re Naruto Uzumaki? Huh? We want you to\Ntalk with us for a bit.

But ultimately the result\Nwas that I allowed him to go… It really couldn’t be helped\Nin light of the situation… No. I should have tried\Neven harder to stop him. But I… Iruka, Naruto, I beg you! Please take me with you! Tsubaki… I understand that I’m making\Nan impossible request! But I want to stop him,\Nno matter what! Iruka Sensei! Tsubaki, I understand how you feel. In that case… I’m sorry, but I cannot allow that. But why…? Why can’t she?! Naruto, we must hurry up\Nand search for Mizuki! If she’s with us,\Nshe’ll interfere with our mission! But… But…! Iruka… If that’s the case,\NI think I'll be of service to you. I have an idea of\Nwhere he might be heading! Is that true, Tsubaki?! There’s probably no mistake… But… I beg you! I think it’s certain that he’ll use various tricks to camouflage\Nhis tracks as he flees… If we spend time on that…\Nit will all be too late! Please take me with you! Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23… Huh, what was the result? The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage… Huh?! Who are you! Dragon, Rooster, Dog… The lookouts have been taken down! It’s an intruder! What?! The Nara Clan’s research lab\Nwas attacked?! Yes… I just received a dispatch\Nfrom the Nara Clan… According to the dispatch, the insurgent’s physical characteristics\Nmatch those of Mizuki. Mizuki’s…? Yes! What is that Naruto doing? But it’s something to have come up\Nwith the idea of the Nara Clan’s institute… Notwithstanding the abundance of\Nnarcotic substances that are stored there, due to its remote mountain location,\Nsecurity is comparatively lax. And what substances were stolen? Well… Because of their thorough control\Nof the substances, they were able to determine immediately\Nwhich substances were taken… So the description matched\Nafter all, huh… But even if a mere Chunin were\Nto remove those narcotic substances what would he be able\Nto do with them? Oh… Thank you. You may go now… Yes ma’am! In any case,\NI can’t take any chances… There’s nothing I can do if\NI don’t know what his objective is. If I can’t discern that from\Nthe actual materials… there may still be some means… Perhaps the proportions\Nof the formula, or possibly the order\Nin which they’re blended… There’s no mistake that\Nit’s this direction, right? Yes… Please continue to\Nproceed just like this. Tsubaki, you said\N“It will all be too late.” But do you know what\Nhis objective is? Probably… Although maybe not totally. Tsubaki, please tell us! In the past, he told me… ""I will get my hands on Orochimaru’s power\Nand go to where Orochimaru is."" What was that?! The reason he stole\Nthe Scroll of Sealing was simply because\Nhe had chosen it as a hospitality gift… Tsubaki… You knew that? I didn’t convey it to the village… Just removing the Scroll of Sealing\Nis a serious felony… And moreover, I was scared for\Nwhat’d happen if his real objective\Nhad come to light… I believed that he would\Nmend his ways. In that case you cannot avoid\Nretribution either. I am prepared for it. I thought it was strange… If you knew where Mizuki was going, you should have pursued him alone\Nin the first place. But you… I may not be able to stop him alone… I want to stop him at any cost… I don’t want him to commit\Nany more crimes. Unbelievable! That Orochimaru…\NSo this was his plan! However, could an ordinary Ninja\Nreally manage to do this…? It’s something only within the realm of an experienced\Nartisan’s technique… I’m busy! I have a progress report on\Nthe inmate prison break incident! All right… Enter! Yes, ma’am! We have just finished\Nrecapturing all inmates with the exception of three –\NMizuki, Fujin and Raijin. Good work… We are now continuing to investigate\Nthe other three… But, the last inmate we captured said\Nsomething that concerned me… Something that concerned you? Yes… He apparently saw the three of\Nthem fleeing together… Fujin and Raijin were fleeing\Nwith Mizuki?! Damn it! Lady Tsunade…? I’m going out! Where are you going? There’s no need for you to come… If what he said is true, the guys I sent out won’t be able\Nto deal with the situation alone… Hey, Shikamaru…\Nlf things continue like this… we’ll be in trouble! We’re already in trouble… Shikamaru… All the Chakra is… I know that… I’ve thought of several methods, but if I let go of these guys we are\Ngonna find ourselves in trouble… You insolent jerk! Having said that, I can’t take them down simply\Nby catching them, so that’s why I’m doing this… I won’t let you leave here alive! These guys have monstrous stamina… And what’s more, although their bodies\Nlook like rubber at first glance, with that much muscle strength\Ntheir instantaneous reflexes are probably quite something too… In other words, you’re saying that this is\Nthe only possible method… Let’s do our best, everyone! Sorry about this… What do you think, Mizuki? It’s no good…\Nlt’s unfortunate but, he can no longer… I see…\NAll right! Let’s withdraw! Hurry up! Yeah… It’s unfortunate but… guys who are of no use\Non the battleground only become a ball and chain… Even though it’s just a minor injury, you won’t be able to move\Nfrom this place, can you? Who’s that?! Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?! I saw that… No way… This can’t be, you’re… Orochimaru?! You are correct… This can’t be…\NWhy are you here? Your whereabouts are supposed\Nto be unknown! It doesn’t matter why… More importantly, I witnessed something\Nvery interesting earlier on… You took the life of\Nan injured comrade, didn’t you? You saw that…? That piqued my interest… That’s not a sight one sees\Nvery often among the Leaf Shinobi who devote their entire time\Nto playing house in the village… So what are you trying to say?! I didn’t do anything wrong!\NI had no choice but to do what I did! You’re a short-tempered child,\Naren’t you…? I’m not reproaching you.\NYou were just carrying out your mission. That’s right… But… Is there anybody in\Nthe Leaf Village who acknowledges you? What did you just do?! What in the world is this…? This is my present to you… Go visit that place if you feel like it. Here it is… Looks like there hasn’t been\Na trespasser here before me… The eighth one on the right… What’s happening? What is that power of\NOrochimaru’s anyway? I don’t know either. And I don’t know when\Nhe encountered Orochimaru either… But I’m positive that the answer to\Nthose questions is waiting just up ahead! That Scroll of Sealing incident… You must be angry about it,\Naren’t you, Naruto? I don’t care about that in\Nthe least anymore… Because I repaid my debt to that\Njerk Mizuki right there and then. But… But? If that guy is still connected\Nto Orochimaru, I need to ask him about something! Because there’s someone\NI need to find at any cost! Sasuke…! It’s up there… All right! That’s everything… With this all… This will … This will make me perfect! This place is… That guy has done something… That smell gives me the shivers… Smell? I was wondering who that was… You guys are really persistent,\Naren’t you? Well, this is very convenient. Because I was intending to take\Nyou guys down anyway. Mizuki… You jerk! Mizuki… Your ambitions end here! Impudent as always, huh…\NHowever, you’re too late! Just like you always are… What is that? Beautiful, don’t you think? Damn it! You guys…should feel honored\Nto be my first prey… What?! That’s…almost like… But that’s they way it is,\Nisn’t it, Naruto…? It’s true, you were actually special. But… Then that’s… Orochimaru’s power! Mizuki… Crappy news pass us by And you become speechless My voice is way too soft So you don’t answer You’re crying   Crying alone What can I do?   I’m crying too “Let my lonely scream ring out\Nthrough the night” I’ll thrash this confused era\Nwith my speed   Yeah And I’ll thrash this confused night\Nwith my speed   Yeah I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar\Nand my speed   Yeah This sinking world and its evil bastards,\NI’ll kick their butt   Yeah That’s what you meant by\Nthe “invincible body”?

Please hurry up with preparation\Nfor Summoning. I want to be sure we’re able to\Nmake our move at any time. Understood! All right, I’ll leave that to you. D-Don’t tell me that… The reason I decided to\Ntrain Sasuke was… because he was like me. A physical Activation?! I see… That’s why he went through\Nthe physical training and increased his speed significantly…! That’s right! Awesome… The Chakra is clearly visible\Nto the naked eye… What in the world is happening?! Don’t tell me that\Nhe learned that Jutsu…! So this is the Uchiha Clan… Exactly… W-What the heck is that?! What a sound!\NWhat’s that technique? That’s just a jab… Huh?! However, it is the one used by\NLeaf Village’s number one technician. That’s the only original technique\Nof the Copy Ninja, Kakashi… It’s the special technique used\Nonly for assassinations… Its secret is in the speed of the jab, and also the physical aptitude\Nthat gives forth a gigantic Chakra, the ability of the Chakra to\Nfocus solely on the target, and moreover the speed of\Nthe jab makes a “chichichichichi” sound… A unique sound attack similar\Nto the rumbling of a thousand birds. And that’s why that technique is called… Chidori: One Thousand Birds! No way!\NThat Gaara’s absolute protection is… It’s impossible… Don’t tell me… Excellent work… That’s… Kakashi’s… Chidori…\NAlso known as Lightning Blade. Lightning Blade? Lightning Blade is another name\Nfor the Jutsu derived from Kakashi’s ability to cut through\Nlightning using that technique. Huh? Cut through lightning? Huh? That sounds fishy… A-Awesome… The real name of that technique\Nis Chidori… The secret is the speed of his jab\Nthat surpasses any human limitations and the intensity of\Nthe Chakra on his arm… And that arm turns virtually\Ninto the equivalent of the swing of a celebrated sword that\Ncuts through everything. But what a reckless technique… That’s not for you to say… Right, Lee? It’s beyond my scope of\Ncomprehension, but… What an awesome technique! I can understand it… If it were me, if I made\Na running start at that speed, I wouldn’t make a direct jab attack\Non the opponent… Or rather, I couldn’t. For an opponent, a straight line attack just gives him\Nan easy chance to launch a counterblow. And moreover, I don’t have the eyes\Nto read that counterblow. I envy you…Sasuke! When I fought you once, I said… Even if one understands visually, it’s meaningless unless\None can move physically… I was filled with\Na feeling of superiority. But now, you have a body that moves\Nat the same high speed as mine. Moreover, you have… the Sharingan! I caught you! Third Squadron.\NWe are ready any time.

It gives me the chills\Njust to remember… When I first saw that thing,\NI wasn’t able to eat… I mean, visually it’s totally… What is… this sensation? He’s hurt, after all… The shell was broken when\Nhis body was incomplete! It’s different! Those aren’t the eyes! W-What was that…\Nthat look earlier on?! Huh…? What’s this…? I can’t see… Kakashi!
